Welcome to the Midland Workshops.   Between 1902 and 1904 the Western Australian Government Railway Workshops were relocated to Midland.
The Midland Railway Workshops ran for close to a century on the Eastern fringe of Perth, Western Australia.

Large and multifaceted, the Workshops were vital to the development and maintenance of the West Australian rail system, and a crucial training ground for skilled tradespeople. Their closure in 1994 brought to an end not only a specific industrial complex but also a complex social community.

Despite the harsh, dirty and often dangerous working conditions, many thousands of former workers regretted the loss of the traditions, camaraderie and pride in workmanship that characterised their Midland working lives.

Birak &amp; Bunuru

These are the two hottest seasons of the year and are known as the First Summer (Birak) &amp; Second Summer (Bunuru)

Running roughly from December to March the winds tend to be from the east with afternoon sea breezes giving some respite if you are close to the coast.

The cooler Birak season was a time of year for burning the land to help with fuel reduction, aid seed germination, clear grazing lands and ease travel across the land.

The hotter Bunuru and the respite of the cooler sea breeze had many people living nearer to coastal areas, rivers and estuaries and as such diets of seafoods became a staple for the people.
