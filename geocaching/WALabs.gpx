Public Transport Authority Public Art

While the PTA is predominately about moving people from one place to another, they have commissioned some spectacular pieces of art which can be contemplated while you wait for your train to arrive.

This Adventure Lab takes you to some examples along the Armadale line. The geofences are fairly generous and you might be able do some stages while on the train. However a closer inspection of these works is highly recommended.

Maddington Station

Travel and Journeys through Country

Three free standing figure sculptures made of burnished aluminium with brightly coloured artwork ceramic tiles representing travel, time and the seasons and special tiles by community members. These works are designed to be bold and colourful and to make reference to ancient shapes and symbols. The symbols used in the designs are associated with Nyoongar ideas about travel,  camps and resting points on a journey, sources of water and food, traditional walk paths and the passing of time as represented by the six seasons.</groundspeak:long_description>

Maddington Centenary Hall and Gosnells Road Board

This monument marks the spot of the Maddington Centenary Hall constructed in 1929, but it was also the location of the Gosnells Road Board from 1907 until destroyed by a fire, along with all the records they contained in 1928. New offices were built in Maddington and local administration for the area did not move to Gosnells until 1973 when the present offices were opened near the corner of Gosnells Road and the Albany Highway. </groundspeak:long_description>

Maddington Park

Take a seat and look across the road at what's left of Maddington Park.
Maddington Farm was established by John Randell Phillips. In 1833 he sold it to Major William Nairn, who renamed it Maddington Park and built a large two-storey house that was a fine example of colonial architecture. The Harris family owned the property from the 1870s until 1983. Vegetables were always grown at Maddington Park but when electricity was connected in 1927,  production increased as pump fed irrigation could be introduced. Cauliflowers and cabbages were the main winter crops, watermelons and rockmelons in summer. Potatoes were also grown.  From the  1950s  to  1970  the property was producing an average of 180,000 cauliflowers per year. Suburban sprawl began to encroach on the market garden and much of the property was sold in 1978 for the Maddington shopping complex. In 2004 the house was devastated by fire.

The Southern River

The Southern River is known as the Wungong River in its higher reaches.
Paperbarks (Melaleuca sp) and Flooded Gums (Eucalyptus rudis) are the most prolific trees in the area. Aboriginal people traditionally used the paperbark leaves for medicinal purposes, including chewing the young leaves to alleviate headaches and other ailments. It was used for cradles, as bandages, sleeping mats, as a building material, for wrapping food and as a disposable raincoat.
Just slightly to the south of Burslem Bridge the Southern River joins the Canning River.
Nyungar people call the Canning River "Djarlgarra". The river provided plentiful food to the Beeliar and Beloo people – fish, eggs, snakes, lizards, tortoises, marron, gilgies and birds were found here.

Grave of John and Frances Davis

John Okey Davis was one of the original settlers in the Canning area and was allocated this land in 1829. Davis and his wife Frances and seven children set sail from London and arrived in the Swan River Colony in 1829.
They had been attracted to advertisements in England for cheap land and were allocated a staggering 7026 acres that covered almost all of what we know today as Gosnells including Huntingdale and Southern River.

The Davis family named their farm Chenies and planted wheat and vegetables. Life was hard and isolated in their new home. Frances died in 1835 only six years after arriving and John died a year later after a long illness.  Both were buried here on their property.
The headstone on their grave is a replica of the original which has been stored for preservation. In 1983 their great-grandchildren planted a tree at their gravesite.

Wilkinson Homestead

Wilkinson  Homestead  was  built  in  1912  on  the  banks of  the  Canning  River  for  John Wilkinson. John, a tailor from Ballarat, relocated with his wife Emma in 1905.  Their  27  acre  property  produced  large  amounts  of  citrus  fruit,  stone  fruit  and  almonds. Like  all  early  properties  fronting  the  Canning  River,  was  irrigated  from  the  river.  Their property is typical of the period with a high pitched roof and sweeping verandah.  Today  the  Wilkinson's  property  offers  a  chance  to  step  back  in  time  and  discover  the history  of  the  area.  The  museum  features  a  collection  of  textiles,  agricultural  machinery, household  items,  furniture,  photographs  and  a  1927 Essex  motor  vehicle.  The  shed  is made  from  material  salvaged  from  the  Maddington  Centenary  Hall,  the  1929  Gosnells Road  Board  building  and  the  Orange  Grove  brickworks.

Woodloes Homestead

Originally the home of Francis and Maude Bird built in the early 1870s. Bird was an architect and a partner of the Mason Bird Timber Company with access to excellent timbers; some of which can be seen in the door surrounds within the house.  The house has an interesting history having been through many owners until acquired by the Town of Canning for restoration and opened as a local museum in 1978.  At the rear of Woodloes is a reproduction of the Congregational Church with the Chimney which stood on Albany Highway until 1988 when it was demolished due to the widening of</groundspeak:long_description>

Mason's Landing

In 1864 Ben Mason obtained a permit to cut timber in the Darling Ranges and within two years was employing 100 men, both at the mill site in Carmel and at the Landing. By 1869 a steam-powered sawmill was established by the riverside to process the timber before it was stacked onto barges and taken down the river to Perth and Fremantle. Francis Bird joined him as a partner in 1871. A wooden railway (later capped with iron) joined the mill in the hills with the landing. Timber wagons were hauled by horses and the route was approximately along that now occupied by Bickley Road. Masonmill Road is in Carmel and sawpits were still in the area when a rose nursery was established on the hills mill</groundspeak:long_description>

This Adventure Lab takes you to some examples along the Armadale line. The geofences are fairly generous and you might be able do some stages while on the train. However a closer inspection of these works is highly recommended.

Gosnells Station

The train station … in between

Landscape scenes of trees and houses sculptured from galvanised steel have been incorporated into the station fences. Outside the station two bench seats have been adorned with the same theme, you'll need to inspect the one on the Lissiman st side.

Riverside Observation Deck

This small observation deck provides an excellent vantage point to view the flow of the Canning River. Some of the abundant bird life of this area may be on show, and if not, you could take a seat and enjoy the relaxing and peaceful setting. This location  has been included in this adventure lab to emphasize the significance of the river in the City of Canning and the current redevelopment the City Centre on the theme of the 'Riverine City".</groundspeak:long_description>

Ouro

You are standing before a nature themed sculpture called "Ouro".This work was created by Lorenna Grant  and reflects a perspective and understanding of nature as a 'cyclic' form. Lorenna took her inspiration, in part, from the constructed wetlands surrounding the administration building as something of a 'return' to what was at the site in the past, a naturally occurring wetland.
The spiral is an ancient symbol that speaks of the life, death and rebirth cycle. This symbol is found on every inhabited continent and is used in Aboriginal art as a symbol of flowing water and the Ouroboros or snake eating its own tail (representing the same events occurring over and over- cyclically)
The poetry embedded in the base of the work speaks of a return to the beginning.

Canning ANZAC Centenary War Memorial

This site is now considered to be the City's main point of commemoration, hosting Anzac Day and Remembrance Day services within the City of Canning. The original War Memorial was situated in front of the Town Hall building on Albany Highway but vandalism caused it to be moved to Memorial Park at the corner of Albany Highway and Manning Road.  As this existing memorial is squeezed onto a small parcel of land between two very busy roads and with the number of attendees at Anzac Day increasing, major events now take place in this safer and more expansive location.
The memorial fountain, made from sandblasted granite, is the work of Susanna Castleden. The Memorial itself consists of four elements: The Memorial Path, the Sites of Conflict, Ataturk's Tribute and the Wish for Peace. Further details of these elements can be found on the plaque to the right of the fountain.</groundspeak:long_description>

Leaf Sculpture

You are standing in front of the city's focal sculpture.  This interesting piece of art was created by Jahne Rees  whose brief was to reflect aspects of the the general culture and heritage of the City of Canning and the specific site location.  Jahne chose to explore the themes that connected the historical use of the site (as a garden nursery) and the current and ongoing role of the City in the life of the community. The work is intended to evoke a range of interpretations including the fertile earth nurturing the seed and a sense of opening and striving upward in a relationship of mutual support and growth. 
The City has had to make some "adjustments" to the base of the work to deter local skateboarders whose 'community use' of the sculpture was causing considerable damage.</groundspeak:long_description>

Town Hall  and Fence Railings

The Canning Town Hall is a heritage listed building that has undergone extensive renovation and restoration  and has been used in the past not only as a centre of local government but also as a dance hall, movie theatre, youth centre and offices for a Seniors' Centre. The railing in front of the building is the work of Peter Zappa whose brief was to develop a railing to replace the existing functional but plain steel post railing that was installed in the 1980's. This artwork celebrates continuous movement and change but also the steadfast qualities of local government.

As the Crow Flies

A stylised tree of colourful crows decorated with designs translated from artwork created by Saint Joseph Primary School students. The artwork also doubles as a bench with an engaging perforated pattern of crows in flight which cast differing shadows depending on the time of day. The inspiration comes from the historic phrase used by travellers and people giving directions to describe the shortest route between two points travelling in a direct line.</groundspeak:long_description>

Sikh Heritage Trail

The Australian Sikh Heritage Trail, a group of interconnected pathways in Adenia Park, Riverton, Western Australia, is a monument commemorating the history of Sikhs in Australia.  The location, adjacent to the Canning River, is significant as the heritage-listed Sikh cremation site.
The winding trail features interpretive signage, plaques, benches, a sheltered area, and a boardwalk by the river.
Information on the signs is organised by theme, such as Sikh farmers, Sikh wrestlers, Sikh Anzacs, Sikh hawkers and Sikh entrepreneurs.

The one-way trail has a length of about 4.5 km, 9 km return, this will take you about 2 hours one way (4 hour return). We recommend parking at the Hardinge Park (observe gate opening times).
Wear appropriate shoe wear and carry sufficient water!
Locations 1 to 3 follow a well-prepared path. Between location 3 and 4 you will have to climb a hill and the path is covered in loose rocks. If you prefer not to walk that section, you have the option to park at the end of the trail and complete location 4 and 5 from the other side.
Mobile reception can be a little patchy throughout the trail, so we have increased the geofence to make sure you receive all data you need.
Where appropriate, we state exact coordinates to find the required information.

Are we there yet ?!?

In the 1850’s and 60’s the Perth region was growing fast, and the demand for timber was high. Clever businessman Benjamin Mason saw an opportunity. First, he harvested timber along the Canning River and established a steam-driven mill at Mason’s landing in Cannington. Soon the Cannington area was cleared and Mason obtained a licence to harvest timber near Bickley Brook, 15km from the mill. In 1864 Mason built a second timber mill in what is today the suburb of Carmel (Mason’s Mill). In 1870 architect Francis Bird joined the operation and led the construction of a timber tramway to transport timber from Mason’s Mill to Mason’s landing on horse-drawn trolleys. From where you stand, the tramway followed down Hardinge Rd, then Bickley Rd all the way to Cannington.
Walking uphill towards the location of where the mill used to be, this walk will take you on a little historic adventure.

Locations 1 to 3 follow a well-prepared path. Between location 3 and 4 you will have to climb a hill and the path is covered in loose rocks. If you prefer not to walk that section, you have the option to park at the end of the trail and complete location 4 and 5 from the other side.
Mobile reception can be a little patchy throughout the trail, so we have increased the geofence to make sure you receive all data you need.
Where appropriate, we state exact coordinates to find the required information.

Boy's Brigade Camp (or what's left of it)

Along the path you will spot a wooden sign of the Mason and Bird Heritage Trail #3.

If you are interested, further down the hill (S32 01.922 E 116 02.934) you will find remains of a foundation.
The foundations here are thought to have supported a brick building that was used by the Boy's Brigade which was active here in the 1960's.

To answer the question you will find a blue sign on a tree stump to your left (S32 01.931 E116 02.943).</groundspeak:long_description>

Convict Fence

Located between Salter Point and Shelley Bridge the convict fence was originally constructed in 1866, during the convict era of W.A. (1850 - 1868) and the remnants of the fence are clearly visible.  It was built to keep a channel open for timber barges from the Mason Bird Company to travel up and down the river.  It is known that convicts, standing waist deep in the water used shovels to keep the channel free of mud, throwing the mud over the fence.

Building a bridge

To the right of your path, you will spot the possibly oldest surviving wooden bridge in Australia.
Built by convicts in 1871/72 it formed part of the Mason and Bird Timber Tramway. The Jarrah decking has been replaced but the piles below are thought to be original Wandoo which supported the Jarrah rails and sleepers over the Munday Brook. Remains of the convict-built embankment and roadway leading to the bridge are still visible.

At S32 01.767 E116 03.828 you will spot an old mine site.

Material taken from this pit (and others in the area) has been used for the Orange Grove Brickwork. Pockets of this specific type of clay can be found throughout the area.

Western Australia has some significant military locations, which have played an important role in the country’s wartime history. There are many military museums from Albany in the South, Broome in the North, and Kalgoorlie in the East.

This series looks at some of the local military sites in the Perth area, which includes World War II Tunnels, local Telecommunications, Spitfires, Tanks and Artillery.

Most museums have restricted opening hours, however the WWII Tunnels and tours of HMAS Ovens are temporarily suspended due to Covid-19.

Important:
The WWII Tunnels location in Mosman Park will take some physical effort to reach the site, however there is a path for wheelchairs and people with walking aides. Please follow the Directional Signs from the Boundary Road Carpark to the Heritage Site - approximately 350 metres.

Aviation Heritage Museum

The Aviation Heritage Museum of Western Australia is owned and operated by the Royal Australian Air Force Association Western Australian Division (RAAFA) and is housed in the Association’s Memorial Estate in the suburb of Bull Creek, approximately 15km south of the Perth CBD.

Despite being owned and operated by an ex-service organisation, the museum’s focus is not restricted to military aviation and the collection features a lot of exhibits related to civil aviation in Western Australia. Most of these items which include uniforms, insignia, aircraft are housed in the South Wing, which also includes their First World War collection. The North Wing is home to the larger aircraft in the collection and has a greater emphasis on the Royal Australian Air Force and its operations during peace and war.

In addition to the two display hangars the museum also has a separate library, photo archive, model aeroplane club-room and of course, a gift shop.

Public Transport Authority Public Art

While the PTA is predominately about moving people from one place to another, they have commissioned some spectacular pieces of art which can be contemplated while you wait for your train to arrive.

This Adventure Lab takes you to some examples along the Armadale line. The geofences are fairly generous and you might be able do some stages while on the train. However a closer inspection of these works is highly recommended.

Victoria Park Station

Mute and Bright

This work consists of two major objects, a large self-patinating steel speaker-bell and a smaller, similarly-shaped speaker in stainless steel. The two objects are linked by an interactive audio program developed by visually-impaired sound artist Rob Muir, referencing the important link the station has with patrons of the nearby Association for the Blind.

Mason's Mill

At this end of the track, straight ahead, is the site believed to be the location of Mason's Mill. It is now a privately owned orchard.
At the hight of the Mason and Bird Timber Company, 138 men worked here, utilising 40 horses and 80 bullocks, producing up to 20,000 feet of timber a day.
Up to 400 people lived in the community which formed around the mill and included shops, a school and a sports ground.

This Adventure Lab will take you by foot or bike (or other non-motorised transport) along what is surely one of the nicest paths in Perth – the southern shores of “Perth Water”.

The tour is best done by walking or cycling, although it is possible to drive from site to site even though that would be defeating the purpose. You can start at either end, or wherever you choose. This Adventure Lab does not require you to visit the sites in any ordered sequence.

The pathways along the foreshore provide outstanding views across Perth Water to the city. Along the way you’ll be able to learn a bit about various activities and land uses that occurred on and near the South Perth foreshore over the years.

Please note that some of the paths are for cyclists only, and some are for pedestrians only. The length of the tour is about 4.7km (if walking) from the Causeway bridge to the Narrows (one way) and a little bit more if cycling. There are plenty of opportunities for rest and refreshments along the way.

Tram Stop

Perth’s first electric tram network was opened in 1899. At its maximum extent in the 1930s the network consisted of over 50 km of track and operated along 35 different routes.

Lines were built all over the inner suburbs of Perth, including to:
o Victoria Park (via the Causeway and Albany Hwy)
o South Perth Zoo (via the Causeway and Angelo St)

This site celebrates the nearby tram stop.</groundspeak:long_description>

Manning Dairy

Mary and John Manning (Senior) arrived in Western Australia in 1852. They owned a considerable amount of property along Mounts Bay Road and established a dairy on the Perth side of Jacob’s Ladder.

John Manning (Junior) moved some of the Mounts Bay herd to South Perth and began a dairy business around 1877. He purchased 100 acres of property known as Location 38b on the South Perth foreshore for ten shillings an acre which came to be known as Southbourne. The Southbourne house was located on the corner of Hurlingham Street and Manning Terrace, and John cleared and cultivated the riverfront ground between Southbourne and Ellam Street, being ideal land for growing crops, pasture and vegetables.

The Manning and neighbouring Douglas dairy helped to supply Perth with fresh milk. (Source: https://southperthlocalhistory.wordpress.com/2011/04/18/manning-dairy/)

Matagarup - which refers to the place where the river is only leg deep, was once a small chain of islands and surrounding mud flats. Where the island currently stands was a much smaller island known as Kakaroomup. This area was a main crossing point from one side of the river to the other, where Noongars could wade through the water. 

The area in which Heirisson Island is currently located is an important area for Noongar people. A statue of Wadjuk Noongar warrior Yagan was erected on the island to recognise Yagan’s strong leadership and resistance fighting during the early years of the Swan River Colony. Amidst the fighting a bounty was set upon his head, he was shot, his head was removed and sent to London where it was exhibited as an "anthropological curiosity". A museum in Liverpool kept it more than a century before burying it with other remains in an unmarked grave in 1964. Noongars asked for repatriation, 177 years later, his head was finally buried in a traditional ceremony in the Swan Valley

The City of Perth is Wadjuk Boodjar (Country) covering the area between Gargatup, the place down by the hillside (in Kings Park), and Matagarup, the place of the leg holes (Heirisson Island), where Noongars would cross the river. This area, near the lowest and easiest crossing point on the Swan River (at Matagarup), was an important communication and trade centre between the coast and the islands. Whadjuck/Balardong custodian Tom Bennell referred to Perth as ”Beerit” meaning ”pathways” due to its importance for meetings, travel and trade. This Adventure Lab Cache will take you on an approximate 12km journey around Wadjuk Boodjar depending on the route you take, you may walk, ride, drive (parts) or use public transport to get around, we recommend you give yourself a good half of a day to complete the adventure.

The Causeway

Following the settlement of the Swan River Colony in 1829, the Swan River was the main transportation link between Perth and the port of Fremantle. Land transportation was difficult as the only river crossing near Perth, a ford at the eastern end of the town, was often impassable for wagons and carts. The next crossing point was 20 miles (32 km) upstream at Guildford, a major detour.

The first causeway was opened in 1843 and was originally a toll road.  (Perhaps the only one ever to be in WA.)

The second causeway was opened in 1867 after severe flooding damaged the original causeway.

The third and current causeway was built between 1947 and 1952 consisting of 2 bridges meeting at Heirisson Island after the Heirisson Islands were turned into a single island. The bridges were the "first truly modern bridges" built in Perth after World War II, being the first bridges in Western Australia to use steel composite construction, and only the second (and third) in Australia.</groundspeak:long_description>

Please be aware the locations for this Adventure Lab are quite a distance from the map marker, make sure you check your nearest Lab point before commencing.

The metropolitan Perth rail network is comprised of five major lines connecting the four Metropolitan Development Corridors and Fremantle to the Perth CBD.

Over the coming years the network is set to expand even further to accomade travelers from Ellenbrook, Forrestfield and extending lines past Armadale to Byford and continuing north to Yanchep.

This Adventure Lab will take you on a tour of the various lines of the Perth Rail Network. You are more than welcome to catch the trains to the stops (it can be done in a single day) if you wish but this is not a requirement, in fact all information can be gained and answered without entering the stations themselves.

This Adventure Lab will take you by foot or bike (or other non-motorised transport) along what is surely one of the nicest paths in Perth – the southern shores of “Perth Water”.

The tour is best done by walking or cycling, although it is possible to drive from site to site even though that would be defeating the purpose. You can start at either end, or wherever you choose. This Adventure Lab does not require you to visit the sites in any ordered sequence.

The pathways along the foreshore provide outstanding views across Perth Water to the city. Along the way you’ll be able to learn a bit about various activities and land uses that occurred on and near the South Perth foreshore over the years.

Please note that some of the paths are for cyclists only, and some are for pedestrians only. The length of the tour is about 4.7km (if walking) from the Causeway bridge to the Narrows (one way) and a little bit more if cycling. There are plenty of opportunities for rest and refreshments along the way.

Coode St Jetty

Before construction of the Coode Street Jetty in 1896, the Coode Street foreshore was used as a landing point for local South Perth residents.

The first ferry service to operate from Coode Street was managed by W. F. Tubbs however it was very irregular. This service was replaced in 1898 by local residents Rowland Pennington and Fred Bailey, who formed a public company, the River Ferry Company, in hopes to bring some regularity to the service. The company had two sailing boats in action, the Mary Queen and the Gladys, however the venture was a failure.

In 1904, Jack Olsen and Claes (Harry) Sutton developed a thriving ferry business on the Swan River, including regular ferries to Coode Street.The Sutton and Olsen families continued to run the service until 1935 when they sold the business to the Swan River Ferries Company.

The private ferry service was eventually merged into the State Transport system and the jetty was rebuilt in 1990.

While the PTA is predominately about moving people from one place to another, they have commissioned some spectacular pieces of art which can be contemplated while you wait for your train to arrive.

This Adventure Lab takes you to some examples along the Armadale line. The geofences are fairly generous and you might be able do some stages while on the train. However a closer inspection of these works is highly recommended.

Armadale Station

Signal Grove

Five tall, coloured sculptures stand outside the main entrance to the station in a piazza area with old wooden railway sleeper platforms. The works were designed to provide a sense of identity that reflect the nature of the site, its locality and history. This is not done in an overtly narrative way but incorporates symbols and images that refer to, rather than illustrate the ideas. The references are to forests and forestry, rail history and related artefacts.

Located on the eastern shores of the Derbarl Yerrigan (Swan River) with scenic views over Matagarup Bridge and the Perth City skyline beyond is Optus Stadium and the surrounding Stadium Park. Acknowledging the site’s significant heritage with this being a burial site for the local indigenous people, the Wadjuk Noongar, and with guidance from the Wadjuk Working Party, it offers a real celebration of Western Australia’s Aboriginal culture in many forms of art and landscape.

The Arbour, a 350m long architectural tensioned cable-net structure, supporting indigenous inspired artwork panels, crawling vines and plants and feature programmable LED lighting is a walk way that weaves and slithers representing a Waugal - rainbow serpent, around a portion of Stadium Park.

Queens Gardens is a beautiful park, i have always noticed a strange calming effect when I have visited, it makes me feel like sitting down and forgetting about what I was doing and taking it all in. It seems to have the same effect on the other people I have noticed in the park.

The history of the site is quite interesting, it is associated with the development of the City of Perth, but was originally used for recreation purposes including horse racing. Later on it was used as a clay mine and brickwork. Bricks that were produced here are part of some of Perth’s most prominent buildings, these include The Perth Town Hall, Barracks Arch and the Cloisters Building. The water lily filled lakes are the old clay pits.

The park features a replica of the Peter Pan statue located in Kensington Gardens in London. There were only six replicas of the statue made and relocated to various parts of the world.

East Perth Cemetery

From the establishment of the first cemetery in 1829 to the closure of the seven cemeteries in 1899 almost all of the people who died in Perth were buried here.

More than 90% of the grave headstones and markers were lost through decay, neglect or wanton destruction since then. Only 800 remain. The headstones tell stories of bravery, tragedy, illness and accident; of success and suffering.

In the middle of the Cemeteries stands a simple Gothic chapel designed by colonial architect, Richard Roach Jewell. Built in 1871 as a mortuary chapel, St Bartholomew’s became a parish church in 1888. After a period of neglect, it is still a consecrated church.

Originally located on the edge of the town, the Cemeteries today are a tranquil haven within bustling inner-city East Perth. They are open on Sundays between 2pm and 4pm.

Find the entrance sign to the right of the main entrance to the Cemetery and Church.  Counting the title lines find the 7th line on the sign.</groundspeak:long_description>

This Adventure Lab will take you by foot or bike (or other non-motorised transport) along what is surely one of the nicest paths in Perth – the southern shores of “Perth Water”.

The tour is best done by walking or cycling, although it is possible to drive from site to site even though that would be defeating the purpose. You can start at either end, or wherever you choose. This Adventure Lab does not require you to visit the sites in any ordered sequence.

The pathways along the foreshore provide outstanding views across Perth Water to the city. Along the way you’ll be able to learn a bit about various activities and land uses that occurred on and near the South Perth foreshore over the years.

Please note that some of the paths are for cyclists only, and some are for pedestrians only. The length of the tour is about 4.7km (if walking) from the Causeway bridge to the Narrows (one way) and a little bit more if cycling. There are plenty of opportunities for rest and refreshments along the way.

Dreamer

The statue depicts Sri Chinmoy (1931-2007), an Indian-born visionary, poet, musician and artist who dedicated his life to Peace. According to the plaque, the statue stands as a universal symbol of humanity’s hope that one day the dream of world peace shall inundate the entire world.

The plaque reads “May all who view the statue in this tranquil natural setting of the Scented Gardens, by the banks of the Swan River, be inspired to meditate and reflect on peace.”

This is lovely place to sit in the shade and rest before you continue on with this Adventure Lab tour of the southern shores of Perth Water.</groundspeak:long_description>

Western Australia has some significant military locations, which have played an important role in the country’s wartime history. There are many military museums from Albany in the South, Broome in the North, and Kalgoorlie in the East.

This series looks at some of the local military sites in the Perth area, which includes World War II Tunnels, local Telecommunications, Spitfires, Tanks and Artillery.

Most museums have restricted opening hours, however the WWII Tunnels and tours of HMAS Ovens are temporarily suspended due to Covid-19.

Important:
The WWII Tunnels location in Mosman Park will take some physical effort to reach the site, however there is a path for wheelchairs and people with walking aides. Please follow the Directional Signs from the Boundary Road Carpark to the Heritage Site - approximately 350 metres.

Wireless Hill Telecommunication Museum

Wireless Hill has been a place of communication for thousands of years, as it was previously used by the Noongar Beeliar Aboriginal people as a lookout and a place from which to send smoke signals.

The Museum building is located within the old Engine Room of the original Wireless Station established in 1912. The Wireless Station was one of Australia’s first links with radio technology, used for telecommunications during World War One and World War Two.

Using Morse code, the Station communicated with ships off the Australian coast using a mast that was 120 metres (396 feet) tall. In 1968 the Wireless Station was vacated and it is now listed on the Western Australian Register of Heritage Places.

The museum features several radio sets and describes the role they played in the defence of Australia and also providing essential communication links for organisations such as the Royal Flying Doctor Service.

Welcome to Bibra Lake.
Bibra Lake is fourth lake (going north to south) of a string of lakes which combined comprise the Beeliar Regional Park. Bibra Lake has many environmental, heritage and recreational values. Bibra Lake was first known as "Walliabup" but was later named "Bibra" after Benedict von Bibra who brought land in the area in 1843.
Bibra lake has an interesting history of supporting a dairy farm, post office ,orchard and market garden. It was also home to a battery attached to the 66 Searchlight stationed here in World War 2 along with the regimental headquarters of the 116 Light Anti-Aircraft. This was the base for many women who served in the Australian Women's Army Service.
Today Bibra Lake offers many recreational activities whilst also providing a conservation reserve for our birds and wildlife. This Adventure Lab will take you on a tour of the area and can be completed by walking, riding or by taking the car but to really enjoy the area we recommend making use of the bike path.

Walliabup Skate Park

Walliabup skate park is one of the newer features of Bibra Lake, after a petition by local school kids who wanted to see the run-down local skatepark upgraded. The skate park takes up an area of 1,200 square metre and includes basketball area, natureplay, shade shelters and amenities. The park is surrounded by
paperbark Melaleuca raphiophylla and Flooded Gum Eucalyptus rudis and other wetland plant species. The area has a seasonally high water table and planted swales have been incorporated to allow hydrological and fauna movement through the site and to accommodate increased stormwater runoff from the skate park’s concrete surfaces.

If you are driving to the CBD, the adventure can be completed in any order, so just park up and hop on the bus anywhere along the route.
However I recommend catching the train into Perth CBD and commencing the adventure at the Red Cat Bus stop 24 - Wellington St Perth Station. From this stop the first location is St Mary's Cathedral.</groundspeak:short_description>

The Perth Mint was Established on 20 June 1899, two years before Australia's Federation in 1901, it was built to refine gold from the gold rushes and to mint gold sovereigns and half-sovereigns for the British Empire.
Along with the Royal Australian mint the Perth Mint is the older of the two mints issuing coins that are legal tender in Australia.

The tour here is well worth it, they conduct tours every sixty minutes, each day, beginning from 9:30 am, with the last tour starting at 3:30 pm

He was a renowned explorer, and a Member of Western Australia's Legislative and Executive Councils for nearly 40 years. The sites of Perth and Fremantle were chosen on his recommendation, and he was responsible for laying out the towns.

Kangaroos on the Terrace
Three large male Western Grey kangaroos in different natural positions, `drinking`, `alert` and `in flight`, created and cast in silicone bronze along with a Joey and Mother by artists Charlie Smith and Joan Walsh-Smith.

This is one of many sculptures and installations in and around the Stirling Gardens.

   <groundspeak:long_description html="False">In 1989 the Western Australian state government established a "Percent for Art" policy. The scheme, administered by the Department of Culture and the Arts, requires that up to one percent of the construction budget for new public works over $2,000,000, be expended on public artwork.

Over 700 works have been installed under the state government scheme since 1989. 

This tour will take you to only 10 scattered around the Perth CBD. All should be easy to locate along with the necessary information to complete each of the sites. Good luck

Bibra Lake has a wide range of habitats making it an ideal place for many water and bush birds.
The open water has a good variety of ducks including Musk Duck, Blue-billed Duck and Australasian Shoveller. The boardwalk contains a shelter that provides avid bird watchers a great vantage point to observe
the wild life. If you are lucky enough you may even spot a turtle or two.

Creation - the Waugal, or the rainbow serpent, and the Derbal Bilya, the estuary of the River.

The Wadjuk boodjar was shaped by the powerful spirit beings that are looking after boodjar today. The Waugals, the giant rainbow snake spirits are the creator of the rivers, their trails all connect together forming the shape of the boodjar.

The wirn (spirit beings) watch over the boodjar, the Waugal is the guardian of all the fresh water sources, and if not respected will make trouble for the people.

Their belief was that if a stranger was travelling through and thought I might get a drink, when he got there it was too dirty to drink. The Waugal would dirty the water up so he can’t drink. He wouldn’t let him drink at the well because it wasn’t the right person, it wasn’t his tribe. If someone was going through and they spoke to the family, and said we would like to have a drink out of your water, could you tell the Waugal, you could get a drink of cool water, clean water.

The City of Perth is Wadjuk Boodjar (Country) covering the area between Gargatup, the place down by the hillside (in Kings Park), and Matagarup, the place of the leg holes (Heirisson Island), where Noongars would cross the river. This area, near the lowest and easiest crossing point on the Swan River (at Matagarup), was an important communication and trade centre between the coast and the islands. Whadjuck/Balardong custodian Tom Bennell referred to Perth as ”Beerit” meaning ”pathways” due to its importance for meetings, travel and trade. This Adventure Lab Cache will take you on an approximate 12km journey around Wadjuk Boodjar depending on the route you take, you may walk, ride, drive (parts) or use public transport to get around, we recommend you give yourself a good half of a day to complete the adventure.

This area is known as Yandellup, which means the reeds are on and near this place, it was cultivated and harvested through an understanding of seasonal changes.

‘The yanjid was a thing that you could eat as well, the bottom roots of it. But you could only do it in seasonal turns, not every day of the week. If you pulled it out certain times, it would cause storms.
Big storms would come. That was the aboriginals ways of acknowledging that rains were going to come.
The fires were used for clearing the area so food can be plentiful the following year.’

Karla is an integral part of Wadjuk Noongar existence, highly symbolic, in Noongar karla means campfire, it also implies the home where people gather to meet around the fire. The Wadjuk Noongar were fire-stick farmers and only Wadjuk Noongars with responsibility for boodjar could burn it.

Today the site is consumed by health, mental and religious facilities.

The City of Perth is Wadjuk Boodjar (Country) covering the area between Gargatup, the place down by the hillside (in Kings Park), and Matagarup, the place of the leg holes (Heirisson Island), where Noongars would cross the river. This area, near the lowest and easiest crossing point on the Swan River (at Matagarup), was an important communication and trade centre between the coast and the islands. Whadjuck/Balardong custodian Tom Bennell referred to Perth as ”Beerit” meaning ”pathways” due to its importance for meetings, travel and trade. This Adventure Lab Cache will take you on an approximate 12km journey around Wadjuk Boodjar depending on the route you take, you may walk, ride, drive (parts) or use public transport to get around, we recommend you give yourself a good half of a day to complete the adventure.

   <groundspeak:short_description html="False">St George’s Hall was the first purpose-built theatre in Perth, opening in 1879. Designed for solicitors Septimus Burt and Edward Stone, it was erected next to their office on Howick Street (now called Hay Street). The first performance took place on 4 December 1879, a melodrama called ‘The Colleen Bawn’ performed by local amateur actors. The inspiration for the design is said to be the Lyceum Theatre in London.

After most of the hall was demolished in the 1980s, only the façade remained. In  2008 the District Court Building was constructed behind the portico, and the architects of the new building have interpreted the St George’s Hall’s history at the entrance to the registry hall.

Take your time to appreciate some of the wonderful architecture of the contemporary theatres as well as the remnants of those lost to development.

Given the building density within this area, the listed coordinates may not be as accurate as desired. However there should be sufficient information in each location’s description for you to find what you need once you have navigated to the general area. Enjoy!

Indigenous Australians have been occupying Western Australia for around 40,000 to 60,000 years.

The first recorded European contact was in 1616 when Dutch explorer Dirk Hartog landed on the west coast but the first permanent settlement was not made until 1826 when a settlement was established at Albany to formally take possession of the western third of the continent of Australia for the British Crown.  The Swan River Colony was established in 1829 starting the official history of European settlement of Western Australia.

This set of lab caches explores the early buildings and places of the Swan River Colony.

Please make note of the answers as they may become useful for a bonus cache that will be published soon..

Old Court House

Perth’s oldest building has the unique claim of being the key place where religion, education and the law were truly born in the young colony. Before the Old Court House was opened in 1837, a temporary ‘rush church’ on the corner of Hay and Irwin Streets had doubled as place of worship and court.

This tradition of multiple use was continued when Perth’s civil engineer, Henry Reveley, was tasked with designing “a suitable building as a court-house which could likewise be appropriated to the uses of a temporary church”. He drew up plans for a simple building with a distinctive Doric entrance, and construction started in 1836.

Opening on Good Friday, 24 March 1837, for worship, the Old Court House started hearing law cases the following morning. Sometimes the school which also used the room had to be interrupted if an important case was to be heard.

Head down the left side of the building past the side entrance to just before the fence.

Byerbrup is the name for both the Perth ridge between Gargatup and Matagarup, and the main camp of the Wadjuk Noongar. This camp is particularly important to the Wadjuk Noongar because it is the location of their karla (home fire), the place they call home. Byerbrup is the home of Wadjuk Noongar leader Yellagonga and his family.

The area known as Byerbrup begins from the western side of the Convection Centre and runs all the way through Spring Street to where the Western Australian Parliament stands.

Once described by a wedjela called John Watson as ‘one of the beauty-spots of those days, plenty of Jarrah trees and gums were around a large pool of water that was always overflowing from the spring.’

In Djeran (in Autumn) the Noongar people would come to the area to feast, at other times they would come to the area to trade items, now this area is a very busy hub for Perth City.

The five 3.5m high cast aluminium pen nibs are dedicated to the planners who designed the Stirling Gardens (Western Australia's first Botanical Garden). It also honours those who wrote the recorded history of the gardens.

This sculpture `Memory Markers` was inspired by the early recording of memories about Stirling Gardens. The shapes are based on the familiar ink dipping nib which expresses the essence of the Victorian Era on which the original formal planting patterns were based.

Point Zero

In today's world of GPS enabled devices distances are measured from where you are to where you are going.

Travelers of the past used road distances and road maps to find their way around.  Each state of Australia had their 'Point Zero' to measure road distances from a central point.

Unlike most states where road distances were measured from the General Post Office located in the state capital city the road distances in Western Australia from 1925 were measured from the corner of the building where the Point Zero plaque is on display.

NE of the Point Zero plaque is a sculpture in the St George's Cathedral lawn area.  Locate the dedication plaque for this sculpture.</groundspeak:long_description>

Rischbieth promoted a Citizens Committee for the Preservation of Kings Park and the Swan River and successfully prevented an olympic swimming pool being built for the 1962 Empire Games in Kings Park.

This adventure takes you on a tour in the Perth CBD.

This tour takes advantage of the free to ride Red Cat Bus route, there are historic buildings, side tours, museums and parkland to checkout along the way.

If you are driving to the CBD, the adventure can be completed in any order, so just park up and hop on the bus anywhere along the route.
However I recommend catching the train into Perth CBD and commencing the adventure at the Red Cat Bus stop 24 - Wellington St Perth Station. From this stop the first location is St Mary's Cathedral.</groundspeak:short_description>
   <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Red Cat stop 8 - Town Hall

The library is the first civic building to be built by the City of Perth since the Perth Concert Hall in 1972, It was completed in 2016.
It is well worth exploring the building, you will discover many interesting aspects, such as the ceiling features a mural by artist Andrew Nicholls, there is a 13 meter tall vertical garden, the tallest in Perth, with more than 3500 plants! It also has an outdoor terrace and free wifi.</groundspeak:long_description>

Welcome to Bibra Lake.
Bibra Lake is fourth lake (going north to south) of a string of lakes which combined comprise the Beeliar Regional Park. Bibra Lake has many environmental, heritage and recreational values. Bibra Lake was first known as "Walliabup" but was later named "Bibra" after Benedict von Bibra who brought land in the area in 1843.
Bibra lake has an interesting history of supporting a dairy farm, post office ,orchard and market garden. It was also home to a battery attached to the 66 Searchlight stationed here in World War 2 along with the regimental headquarters of the 116 Light Anti-Aircraft. This was the base for many women who served in the Australian Women's Army Service.
Today Bibra Lake offers many recreational activities whilst also providing a conservation reserve for our birds and wildlife. This Adventure Lab will take you on a tour of the area and can be completed by walking, riding or by taking the car but to really enjoy the area we recommend making use of the bike path.

Indigenous Australians have been occupying Western Australia for around 40,000 to 60,000 years.

The first recorded European contact was in 1616 when Dutch explorer Dirk Hartog landed on the west coast but the first permanent settlement was not made until 1826 when a settlement was established at Albany to formally take possession of the western third of the continent of Australia for the British Crown.  The Swan River Colony was established in 1829 starting the official history of European settlement of Western Australia.

This set of lab caches explores the early buildings and places of the Swan River Colony.

Please make note of the answers as they may become useful for a bonus cache that will be published soon..

Perth Town Hall

One of Perth’s heritage jewels, the Town Hall took some time to construct. The foundation was laid on 24 May 1867 by Governor Hampton, but it was not opened until 1 June 1870 by Governor Weld. The design was a joint production of James Manning and Richard Roach Jewell. Manning was responsible for all of the woodwork, including the magnificent roof, while Jewell designed and supervised the erection of the main building.

In addition to Council activities, the Town Hall has also hosted concerts, exhibitions, bazaars, lectures, dances, skating, and stage shows. It was also the place that generations gathered every 31 December to hear the New Year rung in by the bells of its clock.

It is near this spot that the felling of a tree marked the foundation of the City on 12th August 1829.

Look for the exposed foundations on the David Malcolm Justice Centre side (south side) of the town hall heading west away from Barrack Street.   Above them are two plaques on the wall. </groundspeak:long_description>

   <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Red Cat stop 8 - Town Hall

Perth Town Hall is Australia's only Gothic style town Hall. It was not specifically designed as a Council chamber or administration center, but rather as an all-purpose meeting place for the people of Perth.

The coloured bricks came from the East Perth clay pits (now ornamental ponds at Queen’s Gardens) and were laid in chequered Flemish bond. Free settlers laid the foundations for the Hall and then convicts completed the building.

The Hall is open to the public from 10am to 4pm, Monday to Saturday, unless hired for a private function.
It is well worth taking a look inside.</groundspeak:long_description>

First Contact by _____ _____
‘They first saw a boat with white sails coming to shore, which they haven’t seen before, you know it would have looked like a big white bird, and the sailors being Wadjellas, made the noongar people think it was their ancestor’s spirits coming back from the dead, from the sea.’

The City of Perth is Wadjuk Boodjar (Country) covering the area between Gargatup, the place down by the hillside (in Kings Park), and Matagarup, the place of the leg holes (Heirisson Island), where Noongars would cross the river. This area, near the lowest and easiest crossing point on the Swan River (at Matagarup), was an important communication and trade centre between the coast and the islands. Whadjuck/Balardong custodian Tom Bennell referred to Perth as ”Beerit” meaning ”pathways” due to its importance for meetings, travel and trade. This Adventure Lab Cache will take you on an approximate 12km journey around Wadjuk Boodjar depending on the route you take, you may walk, ride, drive (parts) or use public transport to get around, we recommend you give yourself a good half of a day to complete the adventure.

   <groundspeak:short_description html="False">The Theatre Royal was the first purpose-built theatre in Western Australia. Then one of the city’s largest and most magnificent buildings, it was built for Thomas Molloy, builder, speculator and local politician. Although the Town Hall, St George’s Hall and, sometimes, the Swan River Mechanics’ Institute were used to stage live theatre productions, the need for a purpose-built theatre in Perth had been long felt in the community and, as a result, the news that Molloy was planning to build Perth’s first theatre was received with much enthusiasm. The Theatre Royal was opened on 19 April 1897. It should have opened the previous Saturday night, but was prevented from doing so “owing to the late arrival of S. S. Rockton with the actors and scenery on board”. The opening performance was of the ‘Silver King’ by the Stanford &amp; Barnes Company. Later in the 1980’s it became adjoined as part of Hoyts Centres Cinema Four but was closed in April 1999. 
The facade survived and the building now houses retail shops.
</groundspeak:short_description>
   <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Since the time of Settlement, the Perth CBD has been home to a vibrant theatre scene and this short Adventure Lab will take you to some of this city’s key live performance locations, both historical and current. The seven locations are in close proximity and you should easily be able to complete the series within two hours. Take your time to appreciate some of the wonderful architecture of the contemporary theatres as well as the remnants of those lost to development.

Given the building density within this area, the listed coordinates may not be as accurate as desired. However there should be sufficient information in each location’s description for you to find what you need once you have navigated to the general area. Enjoy!

   <groundspeak:short_description html="False">Percy Button was a local street entertainer and one of Perth's best known faces from the 1920's to the 1950's. Performing somersaults and handstands, Percy entertained people for a few shillings while they waited to see films, newsreels and theatrical performances at the theaters that were concentrated in what is now the Hay Street Mall, the Theater Royal, the Ambassador and His Majesty's Theater.

Percy was renowned for his grubbiness and in November 1929 local newspaper, The Mirror, dressed Percy up in a long-tailed suit and ran a front page competition asking readers to guess the identity of the cleaned up man. The Mirror offered a guinea's worth of goods for the first opened letter giving the man's name. The newspaper later asked Percy to write the 1929 Centenary Christmas Message.

This artwork celebrates the spirit of the street.

This Adventure Lab will take you by foot or bike (or other non-motorised transport) along what is surely one of the nicest paths in Perth – the southern shores of “Perth Water”.

The tour is best done by walking or cycling, although it is possible to drive from site to site even though that would be defeating the purpose. You can start at either end, or wherever you choose. This Adventure Lab does not require you to visit the sites in any ordered sequence.

The pathways along the foreshore provide outstanding views across Perth Water to the city. Along the way you’ll be able to learn a bit about various activities and land uses that occurred on and near the South Perth foreshore over the years.

Please note that some of the paths are for cyclists only, and some are for pedestrians only. The length of the tour is about 4.7km (if walking) from the Causeway bridge to the Narrows (one way) and a little bit more if cycling. There are plenty of opportunities for rest and refreshments along the way.

The Narrows

The interpretive information at this site states:

“Hot summer nights at the Point.

We always looked forward to crabbing. On hot steamy summer nights we piled into the family car and headed for Mill Point. We always wore old sandshoes to protect us from a nip on the toes.

The river in those days was teeming with delicious blue manna crabs, easily seen on what was then a clear river bed. Father and older brother armed themselves with scoop nets for the catch. Younger brother dragged the large metal tub along to hold the captured crabs, while I carried the hurricane lamp. We filled a large kerosene tin with water from the river and when the water was boiling, in would go the unfortunate crabs. Munching into our meal was sheer paradise and we were, with full tummies, more than pleased to leave the beach in its previous orderly state”.

London Court is a retail arcade running between Hay Street Mall and St Georges Terrace. It was built in 1937 as a combination of residential and commercial premises for wealthy gold miner and financier Claude de Bernales. The design has captured a setting and atmosphere similar to that of Tudor England.
It features a replica of the 'Great Clock' at Rouen in France, and at the other end a replica of the 'Big Ben' clock in London.
There are also many other interesting details and hidden features that are fun to discover.

Welcome to Bibra Lake.
Bibra Lake is fourth lake (going north to south) of a string of lakes which combined comprise the Beeliar Regional Park. Bibra Lake has many environmental, heritage and recreational values. Bibra Lake was first known as "Walliabup" but was later named "Bibra" after Benedict von Bibra who brought land in the area in 1843.
Bibra lake has an interesting history of supporting a dairy farm, post office ,orchard and market garden. It was also home to a battery attached to the 66 Searchlight stationed here in World War 2 along with the regimental headquarters of the 116 Light Anti-Aircraft. This was the base for many women who served in the Australian Women's Army Service.
Today Bibra Lake offers many recreational activities whilst also providing a conservation reserve for our birds and wildlife. This Adventure Lab will take you on a tour of the area and can be completed by walking, riding or by taking the car but to really enjoy the area we recommend making use of the bike path.

Today in Forrest Chase you will see people exchanging goods and services, this central location was also an important trading site for Noongar people, ownership of resources is linked to moort (family) ties and katitjin (knowledge) of its presence and uses.

Daisy Bates wrote of a place where a wilgi garup (ochre pit) is located in Glendalough northeast of Perth which was the property of Wadjuk Noongar boordiya yorga Fanny Balbuk (through her father’s line). Wilgi is a highly valued commodity for ceremonies used by Aboriginal people across Western Australia and was one of the items traded in this area. Wilgi from Perth has been rumoured to have travelled as far as the Yankunytjatjara Pitjantjatjara country that crosses the border into South Australia

The City of Perth is Wadjuk Boodjar (Country) covering the area between Gargatup, the place down by the hillside (in Kings Park), and Matagarup, the place of the leg holes (Heirisson Island), where Noongars would cross the river. This area, near the lowest and easiest crossing point on the Swan River (at Matagarup), was an important communication and trade centre between the coast and the islands. Whadjuck/Balardong custodian Tom Bennell referred to Perth as ”Beerit” meaning ”pathways” due to its importance for meetings, travel and trade. This Adventure Lab Cache will take you on an approximate 12km journey around Wadjuk Boodjar depending on the route you take, you may walk, ride, drive (parts) or use public transport to get around, we recommend you give yourself a good half of a day to complete the adventure.

Indigenous Australians have been occupying Western Australia for around 40,000 to 60,000 years.

The first recorded European contact was in 1616 when Dutch explorer Dirk Hartog landed on the west coast but the first permanent settlement was not made until 1826 when a settlement was established at Albany to formally take possession of the western third of the continent of Australia for the British Crown.  The Swan River Colony was established in 1829 starting the official history of European settlement of Western Australia.

This set of lab caches explores the early buildings and places of the Swan River Colony.

Please make note of the answers as they may become useful for a bonus cache that will be published soon..

Palace Hotel

The Palace Hotel was erected in 1897 by an American entrepreneur, John De Baun, on the site of the Freemason’s Hotel which was originally called Leeder's Hotel from 1831 when owned by William Leeder.  Before that it was called King's Head Hotel and was the first licensed premises in the colony.

When the Palace Hotel was opened, it was considered to be the finest hotel in the southern hemisphere. Boasting of marble stairs, electric lights, hot water, and a bathroom on every corridor, no expense had been spared for visitors.

When the Commonwealth Bank bought the place in the 1970s, it was only a hard-fought local campaign which saved the Palace from being demolished and replaced by a modern office building. After Alan Bond’s company took over the property, it was closed as a hotel and much of the interior was lost, or greatly changed, to erect a tall office block behind the facade.

You are looking for a plaque beside the St Georges Terrace entrance to the office tower.</groundspeak:long_description>

   <groundspeak:short_description html="False">The Piccadilly Cinema Centre (formerly Piccadilly Theatre) is an art deco style cinema and shopping arcade, designed by architect William T. Leighton for mining entrepreneur Claude de Bernales. The theatre and arcade opened in 1938, with the arcade connecting Hay Street through to Murray Street. In 1984 the theatre and arcade underwent a significant refurbishment, with the refurbishment winning an architectural award from the Royal Australian Institute of Architecture. The theatre and arcade are classified by the National Trust of Australia and are included on the State Heritage Register. The Piccadilly Cinema was the last operating cinema in the Perth central business district before its closure in 2013 and until the opening of Raine Square's Palace Cinema in 2018. A redevelopment of the cinema space and arcade is expected to be completed in 2020.</groundspeak:short_description>
   <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Since the time of Settlement, the Perth CBD has been home to a vibrant theatre scene and this short Adventure Lab will take you to some of this city’s key live performance locations, both historical and current. The seven locations are in close proximity and you should easily be able to complete the series within two hours. Take your time to appreciate some of the wonderful architecture of the contemporary theatres as well as the remnants of those lost to development.

Given the building density within this area, the listed coordinates may not be as accurate as desired. However there should be sufficient information in each location’s description for you to find what you need once you have navigated to the general area. Enjoy!

This adventure takes you on a tour in the Perth CBD.

This tour takes advantage of the free to ride Red Cat Bus route, there are historic buildings, side tours, museums and parkland to checkout along the way.

If you are driving to the CBD, the adventure can be completed in any order, so just park up and hop on the bus anywhere along the route.
However I recommend catching the train into Perth CBD and commencing the adventure at the Red Cat Bus stop 24 - Wellington St Perth Station. From this stop the first location is St Mary's Cathedral.</groundspeak:short_description>
   <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Red Cat stop 12 - Central Park

I had to highlight the Western Australian Visitor Centre, It is a one stop shop for travel information, souvenirs and offers free tours about the Perth CBD.
Stop in have break and plan some more adventures.

The Swan Estuary and its foreshore provide habitats for a diversity of waterbirds. The sedges, samphires and trees around this area are essential for maintaining the health of the estuary and the waterbirds.The seagrass meadows provide a nursery habitat for fish and crustaceans. Dead and decaying seagrass provides food for invertebrates that are food for waterbirds. The shallow mudflats are exposed during low tide which may only be for a few hours each day. These mudflats hide mussel deposits and are home to worms, aquatic snails, insects and other minute crustaceans sought after by waterbirds.Other waterbirds trap small fish in the open water.
This adventure is best done on a lovely bike ride which will give you beautiful views of the Swan River and the many waterbirds. See how many different species you can count!

Between an area to the north of where the railway line is now and the Swan River to the south there are ancient wetlands, the train station and cultural precinct are situated on one of a series of pinjar (lakes).

According to Balardong Wadjuk Noongar boordiya Cedric Jacobs, the pinjar were essential for hunting and collecting food.

“This was a supermarket of the Noongar people.”

Food harvested depended on the season and the water levels. Popular animals are gilgie (fresh water crayfish), yaagan (turtles) and koolya (frogs).

An early settler George Grey watched Wadjuk yorga harvesting frogs and turtles. In 1841 he wrote:

“women with their long sticks, and their long thin arms, which they plunge up to the shoulder in the slime, managing to drag them out.”

Today you can see a small wetland outside the Art Gallery, frogs and lizards are returning to a place where they once thrived.

Jeena middar boodjar - gathering feet dancing on this land

Jeena middar (corroborees) are songs and dances that record the katijin, moort and boodjar of Aboriginal people. They were often held when families gathered together.

In March 1833 two Minang Noongar people from Albany visited, a jeena middar was held to welcome them to Wadjuk boodjar.

The Wadjuk Noongar prepared for the jeena middar by painting themselves with ritual patterns. The Wadjuk Noongars sang a kangaroo hunting song, led by Wadjuk Noongar boordiya (leader) Yagan the “master of ceremonies”

Buildings now stand on the ground that was once used for jeena middar, you will need to locate the building at the given coordinates

The City of Perth is Wadjuk Boodjar (Country) covering the area between Gargatup, the place down by the hillside (in Kings Park), and Matagarup, the place of the leg holes (Heirisson Island), where Noongars would cross the river. This area, near the lowest and easiest crossing point on the Swan River (at Matagarup), was an important communication and trade centre between the coast and the islands. Whadjuck/Balardong custodian Tom Bennell referred to Perth as ”Beerit” meaning ”pathways” due to its importance for meetings, travel and trade. This Adventure Lab Cache will take you on an approximate 12km journey around Wadjuk Boodjar depending on the route you take, you may walk, ride, drive (parts) or use public transport to get around, we recommend you give yourself a good half of a day to complete the adventure.

Construction of the square began in February 2016, and it was opened on 3 March 2018.

Designed to acknowledge the significance to the indigenous people, the Noongar people of Perth, the land it is built on as well as the lakes that used to exist under what is now the Perth railway station and Wellington Street.

On the south-western corner of Yagan Square is a 45-metre-high "digital tower", with a wrap-around display screen 30 metres in diameter and 14 metres high with fourteen tall columns rising.

The design of the Digital Tower, with its distinctive tall columns, is inspired by the bulrushes once found around the area up until the early 1800s.

You will need to locate the plaque near the digital tower.

The largest of three dedicated performance areas is the 575 seat Heath Ledger Theatre, named in honour of the late Academy Award winning actor. After an international design competition in 2005, attracting more than 40 designs worldwide, was won by Kerry Hill Architects, construction on the Theatre Centre began in late 2007. In July 2008 the Western Australian government announced that the complex would be named after Heath Ledger, however after a change of government, that decision was modified in December 2008 to apply only to the main auditorium. The centre was officially opened on 27 January 2011.

The coordinates will take you to a laneway running from the Perth Cultural Centre, past the Courtyard  to the Theatre Foyer. Along the wall of the laneway is a stainless steel art installation called “Interval” by  Arif Satar and Audrey Fernandes-Satar.

Welcome to Bibra Lake.
Bibra Lake is fourth lake (going north to south) of a string of lakes which combined comprise the Beeliar Regional Park. Bibra Lake has many environmental, heritage and recreational values. Bibra Lake was first known as "Walliabup" but was later named "Bibra" after Benedict von Bibra who brought land in the area in 1843.
Bibra lake has an interesting history of supporting a dairy farm, post office ,orchard and market garden. It was also home to a battery attached to the 66 Searchlight stationed here in World War 2 along with the regimental headquarters of the 116 Light Anti-Aircraft. This was the base for many women who served in the Australian Women's Army Service.
Today Bibra Lake offers many recreational activities whilst also providing a conservation reserve for our birds and wildlife. This Adventure Lab will take you on a tour of the area and can be completed by walking, riding or by taking the car but to really enjoy the area we recommend making use of the bike path.

Mary Ann Tapper Park

This area was initially owned by Benedict von Bibra to use as a camping place to shorten the trip between his two carpentry businesses in Perth and Fremantle. The land was then sold to a subsequent passive investor before Mary Ann Tapper purchased the land. Mary along with her son Daniel and wife Rosina
starting out as market gardeners, Daniel eventually included dairy cows in order to supplement the families living. Eventually the site of their homestead became the center of the local community with a petrol pump, telephone exchange and post office. Tappers remained on this property until 1965 when it went into government ownership. The site you are now standing on is the location of the Tapper homestead, which included three houses, that of Mary-Ann, her son Daniel, and her daughter, Florence Korten, </groundspeak:long_description>

   <groundspeak:short_description html="False">His Majesty's Theatre is an Edwardian Baroque theatre constructed between1902 and 1904 during a period of great growth for the town. At the time the theatre was opened, it was the largest theatre in Australia, and had seating for over 2,500 people. It is also thought to be the first reinforced concrete building constructed in Perth.

Over its life, the theatre has hosted large-scale musicals, ballet, opera, Shakespearean plays and many other events. It has been renovated numerous times, most notably in the late 1970s when the State Government purchased it and performed an ornamental restoration whilst modernising the facilities provided. Since that time, it has been the home of the West Australian Ballet and West Australian Opera companies, both of which perform regularly.  The theatre is heritage listed and believed to be the only remaining working Edwardian theatre in Australia.

The listed coordinates will take you to the rear of the theatre where you’ll find a plaque marking the original stage door.

The 150th anniversary of the establishment of the Anglican Diocese of Perth and the pioneering work of Bishop Hale was celebrated in 2007.
His areas of interest were the welfare of the indigenous population, the humane treatment of the convicts and the provision of secondary education for the boys of the developing colony.

On 28 June 1858 he opened "The Bishops School" in St Georges Terrace.  The school moved to several sites and since 1961 has been located in Wembley Downs where it proudly bears the title, Hale School.

The coordinates will take you to a fairly well known sculpture created by artist Greg James on behalf of the Old Haleians' Association.

Over 700 works have been installed under the state government scheme since 1989. 

This tour will take you to only 10 scattered around the Perth CBD. All should be easy to locate along with the necessary information to complete each of the sites. Good luck

The State War Memorial Precinct is located in Kings Park overlooking Perth Water. It comprises the Cenotaph, Court of Contemplation, Flame of Remembrance and Pool of Reflection.

The Cenotaph is an 18 meter granite obelisk honouring all Western Australians who gave their lives in the service of their country.

The Court of Contemplation is located at the western side of the precinct and commemorates the conflicts in which Western Australians have fallen, with the walls featuring the names of major battlefields.

The Flame of Remembrance within the Pool of Reflection burns continuously, symbolising the promise of all Western Australians.

Kings Park is one of the most popular visitor destinations in Western Australia, with spectacular views of the Perth Waterways and Darling Range. Spread over 990 acres, the park is a mixture of grassed parkland, botanical gardens and natural bushland on Mount Eliza. Two-thirds of the grounds are conserved as native bushland. Previously known as Perth Park, it officially opened in 1895. Its name was changed to King's Park in 1901 (dropping the apostrophe in later years).</groundspeak:long_description>

The Swan Estuary and its foreshore provide habitats for a diversity of waterbirds. The sedges, samphires and trees around this area are essential for maintaining the health of the estuary and the waterbirds.The seagrass meadows provide a nursery habitat for fish and crustaceans. Dead and decaying seagrass provides food for invertebrates that are food for waterbirds. The shallow mudflats are exposed during low tide which may only be for a few hours each day. These mudflats hide mussel deposits and are home to worms, aquatic snails, insects and other minute crustaceans sought after by waterbirds.Other waterbirds trap small fish in the open water.
This adventure is best done on a lovely bike ride which will give you beautiful views of the Swan River and the many waterbirds. See how many different species you can count!

The statue was unveiled on the 29th September 2011 on the occasion of Sir Charles Court's 100th birthday. The statue is symbolically located on St Georges Terrace near Parliament House and the Woodside Building to highlight Sir Charles' role in the development of the North-West Shelf and Western Australia.

Sir Charles Court served as a Member of the WA Parliament for 29 years from 1974 until 1982 and is famed for his hand in WA's mining boom. Sir Charles was a strong advocate for WA and a man who defended the right of the State to manage its own affairs.

Sir Charles was also known for his divisive decisions including the close of the Perth-Fremantle railway service and his role in the Noonkanbah land-rights dispute which led to a low point between indigenous and government relations. Sir Charles Court died in 2007.</groundspeak:short_description>

Indigenous Australians have been occupying Western Australia for around 40,000 to 60,000 years.

The first recorded European contact was in 1616 when Dutch explorer Dirk Hartog landed on the west coast but the first permanent settlement was not made until 1826 when a settlement was established at Albany to formally take possession of the western third of the continent of Australia for the British Crown.  The Swan River Colony was established in 1829 starting the official history of European settlement of Western Australia.

This set of lab caches explores the early buildings and places of the Swan River Colony.

Please make note of the answers as they may become useful for a bonus cache that will be published soon..

   <groundspeak:long_description html="False">-----Barracks Arch

Built in 1866, Barracks Arch was originally the entrance to the Pensioner Barracks which housed the Pensioner Guards. These were the guards who came to Australia on convict ships that transported nearly 10,000 prisoners to Western Australia from 1850.

Originally based in Fremantle, most convict work later moved to Perth. This created a need for accommodation in Perth for the Pensioner Guards and their families. Architect Richard Roach Jewell was appointed to design an appropriate building.

Today the Arch is one of Perth’s most iconic historic buildings, located at the top of St George’s Terrace, next to the Mitchell Freeway and in front of Parliament House. It not only represents Perth’s convict era, but shows how Western Australia slowly came to feel a need to protect its heritage buildings.

Find the sculpture in front of the arch.  There are some metal plates between the two hands.  You are interested only in the plate in the sculptures right hand</groundspeak:long_description>

This adventure takes you on a tour in the Perth CBD.

This tour takes advantage of the free to ride Red Cat Bus route, there are historic buildings, side tours, museums and parkland to checkout along the way.

If you are driving to the CBD, the adventure can be completed in any order, so just park up and hop on the bus anywhere along the route.
However I recommend catching the train into Perth CBD and commencing the adventure at the Red Cat Bus stop 24 - Wellington St Perth Station. From this stop the first location is St Mary's Cathedral.</groundspeak:short_description>
   <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Red Cat Stop 14 - Qv1

From stop 14, walk through the QV1 Plaza and up St georges tce.

Built in 1866 Barracks Arch was originally the entrance to a large building called the Pensioner Barracks.
The Barracks were gradually converted to offices for the Public Works Department between 1900 and 1904, becoming its headquarters in 1904.
Notable occupants included C. Y. O'Connor, whose office was immediately above the arch.

Inner Perth spans some picturesque river locations. This adventure lab is best done by bike.

Since the final physical cache is hidden west of all the virtual locations, the order has been fixed to east to west. In addition, this will allow for those travelling by car to park since all parking is on the river side of Mounts Bay Road.</groundspeak:short_description>

The Swan Estuary and its foreshore provide habitats for a diversity of waterbirds. The sedges, samphires and trees around this area are essential for maintaining the health of the estuary and the waterbirds.The seagrass meadows provide a nursery habitat for fish and crustaceans. Dead and decaying seagrass provides food for invertebrates that are food for waterbirds. The shallow mudflats are exposed during low tide which may only be for a few hours each day. These mudflats hide mussel deposits and are home to worms, aquatic snails, insects and other minute crustaceans sought after by waterbirds.Other waterbirds trap small fish in the open water.
This adventure is best done on a lovely bike ride which will give you beautiful views of the Swan River and the many waterbirds. See how many different species you can count!

This adventure takes you on a tour in the Perth CBD.

This tour takes advantage of the free to ride Red Cat Bus route, there are historic buildings, side tours, museums and parkland to checkout along the way.

If you are driving to the CBD, the adventure can be completed in any order, so just park up and hop on the bus anywhere along the route.
However I recommend catching the train into Perth CBD and commencing the adventure at the Red Cat Bus stop 24 - Wellington St Perth Station. From this stop the first location is St Mary's Cathedral.</groundspeak:short_description>
   <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Red Cat stop 15, Hay St Parliament

The first stage of Parliament House was completed in 1904. The eastern wing was constructed between 1958 and 1964. The staged construction of the building reflects two architectural styles - the Federation style of the early 1900s and more classical lines and columns of the 1960s.

The grounds of Parliament house has evolved with changes to the City and Parliament house building works. In recent times many native plants from all over the state have been incorporated.

Parliament House has a self-guided tour of the external architectural features of the building, and the Parliament House gardens and formal tours are available Mondays 10.30 am Thursdays 10.30 am and Fridays 2.00 pm. Except public holidays.

Kings Park is one of the most popular visitor destinations in Western Australia, with spectacular views of the Perth Waterways and Darling Range. Spread over 990 acres, the park is a mixture of grassed parkland, botanical gardens and natural bushland on Mount Eliza. Two-thirds of the grounds are conserved as native bushland. Previously known as Perth Park, it officially opened in 1895. Its name was changed to King's Park in 1901 (dropping the apostrophe in later years).</groundspeak:long_description>

Indigenous Australians have been occupying Western Australia for around 40,000 to 60,000 years.

The first recorded European contact was in 1616 when Dutch explorer Dirk Hartog landed on the west coast but the first permanent settlement was not made until 1826 when a settlement was established at Albany to formally take possession of the western third of the continent of Australia for the British Crown.  The Swan River Colony was established in 1829 starting the official history of European settlement of Western Australia.

This set of lab caches explores the early buildings and places of the Swan River Colony.

Please make note of the answers as they may become useful for a bonus cache that will be published soon..

The Old Perth Observatory

This 1896 building, designed by government architect George Temple-Poole is all that remains of Western Australia's first Government Observatory which also included offices and meridian and equatorial telescopes.  Several smaller out-buildings housed equipment to measure the weather and the one o'clock gun allowed locals to standardise their clocks.

Light pollution caused the relocation of the telescopes to Bickley in the 1960s.  The site continued to be used as government offices and has been the central offices of the National Trust of Western Australia since 1985.

The building is currently under renovation.  Near the coordinates and behind a construction fence is an entrance sign pointing right.</groundspeak:long_description>

Honour Avenue plaques sit poignantly against a backdrop of eucalypt trees. Each bears details of service personnel who died during war service and were either buried overseas or have no known graves.

The first Honour Avenue plaques were dedicated to 404 fallen soldiers in August 1919, on the fifth anniversary of the outbreak of World War I. There are currently now around 1800 plaques along the Honour Avenues in Kings Park.

May Circle is the site of the initial dedication, and where plaques are added to the Honour Avenues.  The most recent dedication service was held in 2019.

Kings Park is one of the most popular visitor destinations in Western Australia, with spectacular views of the Perth Waterways and Darling Range. Spread over 990 acres, the park is a mixture of grassed parkland, botanical gardens and natural bushland on Mount Eliza. Two-thirds of the grounds are conserved as native bushland. Previously known as Perth Park, it officially opened in 1895. Its name was changed to King's Park in 1901 (dropping the apostrophe in later years).</groundspeak:long_description>

Guildford

13.4km by road from Perth

The history of the suburb of Guildford had its beginnings in 1827 when Captain James Stirling was despatched by Governor Darling of New South Wales to explore part of the West Coast of Australia. Whilst exploring the Swan River, Stirling was favourably impressed by the fertile alluvial flats around the area now known as Guildford, and replenished his water supplies from Success Spring at Success Hill on the west bank of the Swan River at Bassendean. The junction of the Swan and Helena Rivers was also chosen as the site for a town, and the first surveys were carried out in the Town of Guildford by HC Sutherland in late 1829. The name was chosen after the town of Guildford, in Surrey, England, where James and Ellen were married.  Their property was named “Woodbridge”, which was probably the choice of Ellen Stirling, as she came from 'Woodbridge' in Surrey.

Guildford Goal

Guildford is situated on a peninsular formed by the meeting of the Swan and Helena Rivers.  In Colonial times, its strategic importance was as a river port, servicing agricultural expansion in the Colony.  The layout of the town copied English designs of a central village square and an Anglican church.
In 1841 the Guildford colonial gaol, was largely built by convict labour and is significant as an example of a public building dating from the early decades of colonial settlement in the State. The building has since been renovated  and is now part of a museum.</groundspeak:long_description>

Fish Market Square

Planned in 1829 by assistant surveyor Henry Charles Sutherland as a town market for cattle, sheep, poultry and pigs but only ever used as a fish market, so the name stayed. It's also a great area for a picnic our to go kayaking.
On the other side of the river is Success Hill where captain James Stirling in 1827 found signs of fresh water.</groundspeak:long_description>

Rose and Crown

In 1841 the Rose and Crown became WA’s the first operating hotel. Linked to the Swan River via an underground tunnel, alcohol and supplies were delivered direct from boats through the tunnel to the hotel. Whilst history can’t explain the reasons, staff and owners experience unexplained noises.

Tales of a legless ghost wandering the establishment and a poltergeist playing havoc in the owner’s quarters have spawned.

Leederville

Leederville is named after William Leeder, the first landowner in the area. He arrived in the colony on the 'Rockingham' in 1830, and in 1833 bought land near Lake Monger. Private subdivision began about 1890 and the expanding district was already known as Leederville in April 1895 when it was declared as a Roads Board District. It was gazetted as a municipality on 3 May 1896.

The metropolitan Perth rail network is comprised of five major lines connecting the four Metropolitan Development Corridors and Fremantle to the Perth CBD.

Over the coming years the network is set to expand even further to accomade travelers from Ellenbrook, Forrestfield and extending lines past Armadale to Byford and continuing north to Yanchep.

This Adventure Lab will take you on a tour of the various lines of the Perth Rail Network. You are more than welcome to catch the trains to the stops (it can be done in a single day) if you wish but this is not a requirement, in fact all information can be gained and answered without entering the stations themselves.

Woodbridge House

In 1827 Captain James Stirling identified this land as desirable and built a small cottage for his family.
The farmland was later leased.
Woodbridge House was built in 1885 by Charles Harper and Fanny de burgh. The house has been used for many purposes and was later listed as a Heritage building in 1968 by the National Trust.</groundspeak:long_description>

Darlington Station

Darlington developed as a locality from the establishment of the Darlington Winery in the late nineteenth century.  Unlike Glen Forrest and Greenmount, Darlington was unplanned.

From 1890 to 1954, Darlington was served by the Mundaring Loop on the Eastern Railway, which bisected the town.  Darlington was included in "picnic" and "excursion" train itineraries in the 1930s and 1940s, also making it a popular holiday destination.  In 1966, the line was officially closed by an act of parliament and the tracks removed.

There is an information board located near the given coordinates which will add a lot more explanation to this location and its history.  Please take the time to read it as it is well worth the effort.</groundspeak:long_description>

John Curtin

John Curtin (8 January 1885 – 5 July 1945) was an Australian politician who served as the 14th Prime Minister of Australia from 1941 until his death in 1945. He led the country for the majority of World War II, including all but the last few weeks of the war in the Pacific. He was the leader of the Australian Labor Party (ALP) from 1935 to 1945, and its longest serving leader until Gough Whitlam. Curtin's leadership skills and personal character were acclaimed by his political contemporaries. He is frequently cited as one of Australia's greatest prime ministers.

Curtin joined the Labor Party at a young age and was also involved with the Victorian Socialist Party. He became state secretary of the Timberworkers' Union in 1911 and federal president in 1914.

Curtin was a leader of the "No" campaign during the 1916 referendum on overseas conscription, and was briefly gaoled for refusing to attend a compulsory medical examination. He moved to Perth in 1917 to become the editor of the Westralian Worker,</groundspeak:long_description>

Lord John Forrest

Sir John Forrest GCMG (22 August 1847 – 2 September 1918) was an Australian explorer, the first Premier of Western Australia and a cabinet minister in Australia's first federal parliament.

He was appointed Surveyor General and in 1890 became the first Premier of Western Australia, its only premier as a self-governing colony. Forrest's premiership gave the state ten years of stable administration during a period of rapid development and demographic change. He pursued a policy of large-scale public works and extensive land settlement, and he helped to ensure that Western Australia joined the federation of Australian states.

Shortly before his death, Forrest was informed that the King had approved his elevation to the British peerage as Baron Forrest of Bunbury.</groundspeak:long_description>

Sir Charles Gairdner

Lieutenant General Sir Charles Henry Gairdner, GBE, KCMG, KCVO, CB (20 March 1898 – 22 February 1983) was a senior British Army officer who later occupied two viceregal positions in Australia.

Having served on active duty during the First World War, in which he sustained a serious wound to his right leg, Gairdner spent time at the Staff College, Camberley in the interwar period, and served as commanding officer of the 10th Royal Hussars, 6th Armoured Division and 8th Armoured Division during the Second World War.

Gairdner's distinguished military career was rewarded when he was appointed Governor of Western Australia. He was governor during a number of royal visits to Perth – the earliest being that of Queen Elizabeth II in 1954.

The Perth Chest Hospital was renamed Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital in his honour in May 1963. Gairdner stepped down from his post on 26 June 1963.

Gairdner died in Nedlands, at the age of 84, and was awarded a state funeral.</groundspeak:long_description>

Sir David Brand

Sir David Brand KCMG (1 August 1912 – 15 April 1979) was an Australian politician.

A member of the Liberal Party, he was a Member of the Legislative Assembly of Western Australia from 1945 to 1975, and also the 19th and longest-serving Premier of Western Australia, serving four terms from the 1959 to the 1971 election.

The mining-pastoral boom of the 1960s played a big part in ensuring for Brand's government four successive electoral victories over the ALP opposition . However, the rapid growth of the Perth metropolitan area, and the strain this put on essential services, eroded the government's popularity, especially after 1969. In addition, Brand's relations with the federal Liberal Party worsened after the retirement of Sir Robert Menzies in 1966.

In 1971 Brand's Coalition lost the election by 1 seat.

Brand led the Liberals in opposition until his resignation in 1973; Sir Charles Court succeeded him as the party's leader. He died of heart disease in Carnamah, Western Australia in 1979.</groundspeak:long_description>

Azelia Ley Homestead Museum

Azelia Ley (nee Manning) grew up on the nearby Davilak Estate, and in 1900 married John Ley, a customs officer. In 1915, her mother Florence divided her fathers estate into portions for each of their children, and 152 acres was transferred to Azelia.

She began buildings the Manning Tree House (now Azelia Ley Homestead Museum) in 1923, although she only moved into the property in 1927 after her husbands death. She lived on the property and managed her farm until her death in 1954.

In the Early 1980's the City of Cockburn along with some prominent residents decided to restore the residence and transform it into a musuem, which officially opened on 12th November 1983.</groundspeak:long_description>

Fremantle

21.7km by road from Perth

Named after Captain Charles Howe Fremantle who arrived at the Swan River Colony on 2 May 1829, on the HMS 'Challenger'. Fremantle had been despatched from the Cape of Good Hope on the 20 March of that year, by Commodore Schomberg of the Indian Squadron, and after anchoring off the mouth of the Swan River, hoisted the British flag on the South Head, and took formal possession in the name of His Majesty King George IV, of "all that part of New Holland which is not included within the territory of New South Wales". The name Fremantle has, at times, and in various records been incorrectly spelt as 'Freemantle'.

The Beacon Theatre

The building across the road to the west was opened in 1937 as a cinema. The name of the cinema “Beacon Theatre” can still be seen on the façade at the top. It also boasted the Gardens, which was an outdoor cinema at the rear of the building.
It remained a cinema until 1961 when it was converted to Stammers Supermarket and the Gardens became the supermarket carpark.
Stammers moved out around 1995 and it has had a variety of different rolls since then.

Swan View Station

The second section of the Eastern Railway from Guildford to Chidlow was opened in March 1884.  This line passed through Smiths Mill (Glen Forrest) and headed eastwards through Sawyers Valley and Lion Mill (Mt Helena).  However, it was found that the trains were unable to haul economic loads up the steep inclines and also experienced excessive wear &amp; tear from the tight curves in the line.

This resulted in the construction of a second line from Bellevue running roughly parallel to the original line.  Swan View Station was the second station on this line before the rise up the escarpment towards Lion Mill (Mt Helena). The station under went renovations in the late 1990's and is an ideal spot to start the adventure.

There is an information board located near the given coordinates which will add a lot more explanation to this location and its history.  Please take the time to read it as it is well worth the effort.</groundspeak:long_description>

Sandalford Winery

The history of the Swan Valley’s grape industry dates back nearly 200 years to the early colonial settlement in Guildford.

In 1829, the very first vines were planted at Olive Farm in South Guildford by botanist Thomas Waters. He recognised that the region’s warm climate and dry summers were the perfect recipe for grape growing.

In 1840, the first vines were planted at Sandalford. While Sandalford is best known for its wines today, the Roe family were initially significant table grape producers for the region.

The 1850s saw the emergence of a new generation of land owners in the Swan Valley. During this time, the demand for dried fruit, fresh table grapes, export table grapes and colonial wine saw an abundance of new plantings.

Western Australia has some significant military locations, which have played an important role in the country’s wartime history. There are many military museums from Albany in the South, Broome in the North, and Kalgoorlie in the East.

This series looks at some of the local military sites in the Perth area, which includes World War II Tunnels, local Telecommunications, Spitfires, Tanks and Artillery.

Most museums have restricted opening hours, however the WWII Tunnels and tours of HMAS Ovens are temporarily suspended due to Covid-19.

Important:
The WWII Tunnels location in Mosman Park will take some physical effort to reach the site, however there is a path for wheelchairs and people with walking aides. Please follow the Directional Signs from the Boundary Road Carpark to the Heritage Site - approximately 350 metres.

The Chimney

This chimney is all that remains of the Fremantle Freezing Works. The freezing and cooling works were built in 1921 to support the Robb's Jetty Abattoir. Cattle  and sheep would arrive by boat or train. Before the long jetty was built the cattle would be off loaded off the beach and made to swim to shore.
The area was also home to skin drying sheds and tanneries. Driving down Cockburn Rd in those days was not a pleasant experience.
The abattoir was shut down in 1992 and all the equipment was removed by 1994 and the building demolished.</groundspeak:long_description>

Western Australia has some significant military locations, which have played an important role in the country’s wartime history. There are many military museums from Albany in the South, Broome in the North, and Kalgoorlie in the East.

This series looks at some of the local military sites in the Perth area, which includes World War II Tunnels, local Telecommunications, Spitfires, Tanks and Artillery.

Most museums have restricted opening hours, however the WWII Tunnels and tours of HMAS Ovens are temporarily suspended due to Covid-19.

Important:
The WWII Tunnels location in Mosman Park will take some physical effort to reach the site, however there is a path for wheelchairs and people with walking aides. Please follow the Directional Signs from the Boundary Road Carpark to the Heritage Site - approximately 350 metres.

WWII Tunnels

Leighton Battery at Buckland Hill, Mosman Park, Western Australia, was part of the Coastal defences of Australia during World War II and the Fremantle Fortress, protecting Fremantle Harbour.

The battery initially consisted of two 6-inch Mk VII naval guns, operational from February 1943. The two guns were removed in 1945 and replaced by three 5.25 inch dual purpose coastal artillery/antiaircraft guns.

While it was envisioned to have all major ports in Australia protected by these type guns, the Leighton Battery became the only one ever operational. The battery was dismantled and the equipment disposed of for scrap in 1963.


Please follow the Directional Signs from the Boundary Road Carpark to the Heritage Site - approximately 350 metres.

Fremantle Arts Centre

The Fremantle Arts Centre is Western Australia’s most haunted location and is in Australia’s most haunted lists. Built in the 1860’s, the chequered history of the building begins with convict hands laying the all the stone in Gothic architecture.
It was the Swan Colony’s lunatic asylum and dumping ground for the states most disturbed and those deemed invalid. Over the years overcrowding lead to the suspicious death of a patient, Ms Clifford.

In later years the building became a women’s home with stories of mistreatment, escapes and suicide.

Lingering souls roam the halls and have been known to touch visitors, drop temperatures and even making appearances whilst whispering to those unwilling to listen.

The First Fremantle Cemetery

You are now standing in what was Fremantle’s first cemetery. The first recorded burial here was on the 3rd April 1831. It remained in service until 1855 when the cemetery in Skinner St was opened. After that date the only people buried at this site were those that had close relatives here.
This cemetery was closed in 1895 and some of the bodies were exhumed and taken to the current Fremantle cemetery or Karrakatta.
Early Recycling.
When the cemetery was closed not all of the headstones were moved to the new cemeteries. Some were used as slabs for footpaths and one was later discovered as the hearthstone in an old house.</groundspeak:long_description>

Indigenous Australians have been occupying Western Australia for around 40,000 to 60,000 years.

The first recorded European contact was in 1616 when Dutch explorer Dirk Hartog landed on the west coast but the first permanent settlement was not made until 1826 when a settlement was established at Albany to formally take possession of the western third of the continent of Australia for the British Crown.  The Swan River Colony was established in 1829 starting the official history of European settlement of Western Australia.

Fremantle Prison

Fremantle Prison was built as a convict barracks in the 19th century and remained in continual use until 1991. The Prison was a place of hangings, floggings, dramatic convict escapes and prisoner riots.

The Convict Establishment, as the prison was first known, was built by convict labour between 1852 and 1859 using limestone quarried on the site. The first prisoners moved into the main cell block in 1855.

It was renamed Fremantle Prison in 1867.

Fremantle Prison was decommissioned on 8 November 1991 and its prisoners transferred to Casuarina Prison, replacing Fremantle Prison as the state's main maximum-security prison.

After its closure the WA state government embarked on a long-term conservation plan to ensure the Prison’s preservation for future generations. Fremantle Prison is one of the largest surviving convict prisons in the world today.

Fremantle Prison

In 1855 when Fremantle Prison opened, it was Western Australia’s maximum-security prison and the only lawfully place of execution. Over its 136 year operation, 44 people had their lives ended in the gallows of the prison.

With such a grim history, Fremantle Prison is said to be the second most haunted location in WA. After hours, past convicts are said to roam the cold corridors looking for redemption, retribution or just to plead innocence.

Martha Rendall, convicted of the murders of her own three children, was only female sentenced to death at the prison. Legend has it, she remains and has been sighted watching in the chapel window.

Stories of a ghost named Jack exist after he breathed on visitors with tainted breath.

Oddly, owls have been noted landing by the gallows on the anniversaries of those whose finished this world here.

To the left of the entrance, is an Australian Convict Site monument.

The Omeo

The 605-ton barque-rigged iron screw steamer was built at Newcastle, England in 1858. Part of its cargo on its maiden voyage to Australia were the materials and equipment for laying the Bass Strait submarine cable. After many years carrying passengers and cargo between Melbourne and Adelaide and then  New Zealand Omeo was sent to Port Darwin in 1870 on charter to the  contractors  completing the northern section of the Overland Telegraph line linking Australia to Britain via Singapore.  She then played a major part in the construction of the overland telegraph line from Darwin, carrying telegraph poles and cargo 160 km up the Roper River. After making over 100 round trips to New Zealand her engines were removed in 1880 and her funnel replaced with a new mast. As a 4-masted ‘jackass barque’ ( Two square and two barque rigged masts). In that distinctive livery Omeo voyaged between Melbourne and Newcastle and  it traded for many years in the Pacific and Indian Oceans carrying passengers and cargo.

Coogee dive and snorkel trail

The trail begins in shallow water while its westernmost extent reaches a maximum depth of 7 metres.

The underwater art gallery includes a giant sea star which divers can swim through, an old railway wheel, anchor and Dutch inspired replica cannon and a sea lion near the shore. You can experience a large variety a marine life on the trail including a variety of fish, starfish, cuttlefish, nudibranchs, sea squirts and corals.

The purpose-built reef consists ofover 55 reef modules, ranging in height from 1m to 5m tall. The reef has been designed by marine engineers and scientists to support a diverse range of aquatic flora and fauna. The unique sections create a complex reef that includes lots of cave-like spaces to support fish, crays and molluscs and are great for snorkelling and scuba diving.  Larger species will be attracted to the tall reef temple which includes a swim through.
The reef will weigh over 30 tonnes in total, and all reef modules are fabricated from fibre-reinforced concrete.

Please be aware the locations for this Adventure Lab are quite a distance from the map marker, make sure you check your nearest Lab point before commencing.

The metropolitan Perth rail network is comprised of five major lines connecting the four Metropolitan Development Corridors and Fremantle to the Perth CBD.

Over the coming years the network is set to expand even further to accomade travelers from Ellenbrook, Forrestfield and extending lines past Armadale to Byford and continuing north to Yanchep.

This Adventure Lab will take you on a tour of the various lines of the Perth Rail Network. You are more than welcome to catch the trains to the stops (it can be done in a single day) if you wish but this is not a requirement, in fact all information can be gained and answered without entering the stations themselves.

The Railway Reserves Heritage Trail follows the route of the old Eastern Railway and is unique in providing a 41 kilometer loop entirely on railway formations. This extensive trail passes through quaint hills communities including Darlington, Parkerville and Mundaring, and covers a wide range of terrains with scenic views and numerous points of historical and natural significance.

This adventure will take you to five different points along the trail and should only take a few hours to complete.  Most can be reached by driving to nearby parking areas with a short stroll to the required locations.  The longest walk is approximately 2 klm round trip between locations 1 and 2.  These trails are well kept and easily accessible to all ages and levels of fitness.

Mobile reception can be patchy along the trail in certain spots, so we have increased the geofence to ensure all relevant information and data is available to you.  Always wear appropriate footwear, hat, sunscreen and carry enough water.

Swan View Tunnel

The Swan View Tunnel is located further up the line from the Swan View Station, was built in 1895 and is the earliest railway tunnel in West Australian's history.  Engineer Charles O'Connor designed the 340m Swan View Tunnel to overcome a granite barrier formed by a fold in the Darling Range.

A deviation was built around the tunnel in 1945.  This was due to a number of fatalities caused by the slow upward progress of the trains in the tunnel coupled with poor ventilation.  The deviation was then used by the "up trains", while the "down trains" continued to use the tunnel as they could coast through at greater speeds.  The tunnel ceased to be used after the new Avon Valley rail route was opened in 1966.

Make sure you bring a torch to check out some of the interesting features inside the tunnel, such as the masonry-lined face &amp; roof which was carried out to prevent rock falls.

Indigenous Australians have been occupying Western Australia for around 40,000 to 60,000 years.

The first recorded European contact was in 1616 when Dutch explorer Dirk Hartog landed on the west coast but the first permanent settlement was not made until 1826 when a settlement was established at Albany to formally take possession of the western third of the continent of Australia for the British Crown.  The Swan River Colony was established in 1829 starting the official history of European settlement of Western Australia.

The WA Shipwrecks Museum is recognized as the foremost maritime archaeology museum in the southern hemisphere.

The Museum is housed in 1850s-era Commissariat building and has since been restored to its historic glory.

Steeped in history, the galleries house hundreds of relics from ships wrecked along WA’s treacherous coastline, including the original timbers from the Batavia (wrecked in 1629), the de Vlamingh Dish, and also countless artifacts from the Dutch shipwrecks Zuytdorp, Zeewijk and Vergulde Draeck.

Weir Wall

The dam overflowed regularly and as demand increased the wall was raised a further 32 feet shortly after World War II.  Although the wall was raised, overflows still occurred until the 1960's.  With a growing population &amp; a drying climate, the Lower Helena Dam was created to pump water back to the weir.

At this location is an another iconic viewing point of the weir &amp; also the highly photographed valves.

The Round House, on Arthur Head, is neither a house nor round. It is dodecagonal, having twelve sides, and was built as a jail in 1830-1 (twenty years before convicts arrived).

This makes it the oldest public building in the State.

During 1966 the standard gauge railway was extended past the end of High Street and the original steps were partly demolished and rebuilt in their present form.

Thomas Crowley Hodgson recommended the site of the weir for what appeared to be foundations of solid granite, where a 100ft high concrete wall would be constructed.  He wrote in his recommendations that the hilly and rocky catchment would fill the reservoir each year.

This spot will take you to a fantastic viewing point of the weir wall iconic inner valve tower.  Don't forget your camera!

Western Australia has some significant military locations, which have played an important role in the country’s wartime history. There are many military museums from Albany in the South, Broome in the North, and Kalgoorlie in the East.

This series looks at some of the local military sites in the Perth area, which includes World War II Tunnels, local Telecommunications, Spitfires, Tanks and Artillery.

Most museums have restricted opening hours, however the WWII Tunnels and tours of HMAS Ovens are temporarily suspended due to Covid-19.

Important:
The WWII Tunnels location in Mosman Park will take some physical effort to reach the site, however there is a path for wheelchairs and people with walking aides. Please follow the Directional Signs from the Boundary Road Carpark to the Heritage Site - approximately 350 metres.

Fremantle Maritime Museum

Perched on the Indian Ocean's shore, the WA Maritime Museum is symbolic of Fremantle’s past, present and future as a coastal city and port.

The Museum houses several unique galleries that explore WA's maritime relationship. From leisure boats and handcrafted sailing boats to commercial pearl luggers, the Museum inspires visitors to discover WA’s affinity with the ocean.

To the left of the museum lies the 89 metre (295 feet) long Oberon class Submarine, HMAS Ovens. It is an authentic Cold War-era vessel situated on Fremantle's historic World War Two submarine slipway, part of the home base for an Allied submarine fleet, which was stationed here during the war.  Amongst controls, sensors, tactical equipment and torpedoes, 63 people lived and served aboard the vessel in extremely cramped conditions.

The HMAS Ovens exhibit serves as a living memorial to submariners and those who gave their lives while serving from Fremantle during World War Two.

Located in the Perth Hills, the Mundaring Weir is one of the world's greatest engineering projects.

Completed in 1903, the weir is the start of the water pipeline that pumps water to the Kalgoorlie goldfields some 700km away.

We have created this adventure lab to highlight some of the history &amp; beauty of the precinct. 

Mundaring Weir is a great spot to take the family &amp; the little ones will enjoy feeding the birds, enjoy!

Pleasure Garden

The surrounding area was known as the Pleasure Garden &amp; was laid by Paddy Dawson, a former weir construction worker in the 1920's.  He &amp; his wife lived in this area in the old stationmasters house &amp; his wife sold tea &amp; flowers from the nearby rose garden to the hundreds of visitors that would visit the dam by train each weekend.

Today there is also a new playground as well as electric BBQs &amp; toilets, but the rose garden &amp; exotic gardens still stand.

Municipal Heritage Inventory -
It is mandatory under the Heritage of Western Australia Act 1990 for each local government
to maintain a Municipal Heritage Inventory (MHI). The Shire of Mundaring MHI lists many
places that contribute to the history and character of the local area and classifies them
according to the degree of significance. Modification of places on the MHI may not always
require planning approval, although sympathetic design is still recommended to maintain the
character and heritage values.

Mundaring Weir Hotel

The Mundaring Weir Hotel is located adjacent to the formation of the former branch line to the weir - the Mundaring Weir Railway on a hill to the north, and above Mundaring Weir.

It was previously known as the Reservoir Hotel, then the Goldfields Weir Hotel and has been in the area since 1898. It was a crucial location where C Y O'Connor stayed regularly during the construction of the weir.

MHI site 50 - The Mundaring Weir Hotel has very high social, historic and aesthetic significance, both locally and State, for its associations with the Weir’s construction, operation and tourist activities together with its two storey architectural style of which there are only several examples in the Shire.</groundspeak:long_description>

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Whiteman Park is a 4,000-hectare bushland area located 22 km north of Perth, WA. The park is in the suburb of Whiteman, in the Swan Valley in the upper reaches of the Swan River.
It encompasses the source of Bennett Brook - an important place of the Nyoongar people, and a source of mythology of the Wagyl and stories about Aboriginal occupancy of the area.
Whiteman Park is known for its biodiversity, including more than 450 endemic plants and more than 120 vertebrate animals (some of which are rare and endangered). More than 17% of Western Australian bird species occur in Whiteman Park, including migratory birds attracted to the habitat provided by Bennett Brook and associated wetlands including Grogan's Swamp, a Conservation Category Wetland.
The state government purchased the land from a number of private owners in 1978 to protect the underlying aquifer as a drinking water source for Perth. The major owner was Lew Whiteman (1903–1994), after whom the park is named.

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Whiteman Park is a 4,000-hectare bushland area located 22 km north of Perth, WA. The park is in the suburb of Whiteman, in the Swan Valley in the upper reaches of the Swan River.
It encompasses the source of Bennett Brook - an important place of the Nyoongar people, and a source of mythology of the Wagyl and stories about Aboriginal occupancy of the area.
Whiteman Park is known for its biodiversity, including more than 450 endemic plants and more than 120 vertebrate animals (some of which are rare and endangered). More than 17% of Western Australian bird species occur in Whiteman Park, including migratory birds attracted to the habitat provided by Bennett Brook and associated wetlands including Grogan's Swamp, a Conservation Category Wetland.
The state government purchased the land from a number of private owners in 1978 to protect the underlying aquifer as a drinking water source for Perth. The major owner was Lew Whiteman (1903–1994), after whom the park is named.

Welcome

The Park is a biodiversity hotspot, providing habitat for a range of native fauna species and acting an important haven for migratory birds.It provides essential breeding and feeding habitats for these itinerant species as well as a natural area within the surrounding urban environment where mammals, birds and reptiles can thrive.

There is also a service station and hotel close by.

Hovea Station

Hovea Station was the first train station in the park and was built in 1912.  It also served the nearby farmers and workers who commuted to Midland.

The famous line of palms determine the old platform and the nearby pad is still visible where the Station Masters house stood.

The rail line ceased being used in 1966.

Mundaring Station &amp; Signal Tower

Our last destination is the old Mundaring Station and adjoining Sculptor Park.

The original Eastern Railway passed through Mundaring on its first route through to Chidlow, and Mundaring Station was known as the central point for the region.  It also played a significant role for the construction of the Mundaring Weir and associated rail lines.

Following the construction of the second route of the Eastern Railway, the Mundaring line served as an alternative to the second route at the time of accidents and derailments, until its closing to traffic in 1954.

As with the other locations, there are several information boards near the given coordinates that look at all the different locations and attractions the area has to offer, such as Mundaring Weir, located south of Mundaring on Mundaring Weir Rd.

This is also a good place to finish the adventure with the park, play areas, picnic tables and BBQ’s.</groundspeak:long_description>

Welcome to Mundaring.  Mundaring is a pleasant town on the eastern edge of the Perth Hills. It's famous in Western Australia for the Mundaring Weir which, through the remarkable engineering achievements of Charles Yelverton O'Connor, has supplied water to towns in the wheatbelt and the gold towns of Kalgoorlie and Coolgardie. Since the dam was built people have come from Perth to marvel at this watery saviour of the Eastern Goldfields.
In this adventure we'll explore a few locations of interest in the Mundaring townsite.  All waypoints are located in walking distance and can easily be completed in under an hour.  But be sure to take some time to enjoy all that this charming little town has to offer.
Please note that any answers requiring numbers shall be in written form.

Munda Biddi Northern Terminus

Munda Biddi means 'path through the forest' in the Noongar Aboriginal language. The trail meanders through scenic river valleys and the magnificent eucalypt forests of WA's South West. There are few places left in the world where a 1000km track could be built through an undeveloped natural corridor.

Station Masters House

When the townsite of Mundaring was gazetted in May 1898, one of the earliest buildings constructed was the railway station. The brick and iron station-master's house was built some time later, and is one of the few remaining railway residences in the shire. The others are a weatherboard and iron house at Glen Forrest (Site 102), and what is thought to be the former station-master's residence at Wooroloo.</groundspeak:long_description>

Mundaring Sculpture Park

Located in the heart of Mundaring, the Park underwent a major redevelopment in 2016.
The redevelopment was supported by Lotterywest and the Department of Parks and Wildlife and incorporates a playzone where children will be able to enjoy a range of new equipment and a nature play area. One of the key attractions is the Ornate Crevice Dragon located in the sandpit, where children can dig for her eggs and insects.
There is also the boardwalk tunnel onto the equipment and rocks to climb. With ramps, soft fall and many accessible equipment pieces, this is an inclusive playground for the whole community.
Shaded areas are also available, with free gas BBQs, picnic tables, public toilets, information boards and a series of specially commissioned sculptural works featuring some of Western Australia's best known artists.

Municipal Heritage Inventory -
It is mandatory under the Heritage of Western Australia Act 1990 for each local government
to maintain a Municipal Heritage Inventory (MHI). The Shire of Mundaring MHI lists many
places that contribute to the history and character of the local area and classifies them
according to the degree of significance. Modification of places on the MHI may not always
require planning approval, although sympathetic design is still recommended to maintain the
character and heritage values.

Mundaring Hotel

The Mundaring Hotel was opened in 1899 in Mundaring, a hills suburb of Perth, Western Australia.

Municipal Heritage Inventory -
It is mandatory under the Heritage of Western Australia Act 1990 for each local government
to maintain a Municipal Heritage Inventory (MHI). The Shire of Mundaring MHI lists many
places that contribute to the history and character of the local area and classifies them
according to the degree of significance. Modification of places on the MHI may not always
require planning approval, although sympathetic design is still recommended to maintain the
character and heritage values.

Welcome to Mundaring.  Mundaring is a pleasant town on the eastern edge of the Perth Hills. It's famous in Western Australia for the Mundaring Weir which, through the remarkable engineering achievements of Charles Yelverton O'Connor, has supplied water to towns in the wheatbelt and the gold towns of Kalgoorlie and Coolgardie. Since the dam was built people have come from Perth to marvel at this watery saviour of the Eastern Goldfields.
In this adventure we'll explore a few locations of interest in the Mundaring townsite.  All waypoints are located in walking distance and can easily be completed in under an hour.  But be sure to take some time to enjoy all that this charming little town has to offer.
Please note that any answers requiring numbers shall be in written form.
The state government purchased the land from a number of private owners in 1978 to protect the underlying aquifer as a drinking water source for Perth. The major owner was Lew Whiteman (1903–1994), after whom the park is named.

Old Post Office

The first post office in Mundaring operated from July 1898, to late 1925 in a weatherboard and iron building on the corner of Jacoby and Hodgson Streets. As well as posts and telegraphs, from sometime after 1912, the post office, in common with many others, operated as a Commonwealth Savings Bank Agency. The original post office is now used as a playgroup centre. In early 1926, in line with the shift of the commercial centre of Mundaring from the railway line side of town to the York Road (Great Eastern Highway), a new weatherboard and iron post office was opened on the corner of York Road and Nichol Street.  In June 1997, after some internal modifications, the former post office building re-opened as the Mundaring Art Gallery, which had previously operated from a converted service station in Great Eastern Highway Mahogany Creek.

At this location is a plaque in the ground.  This plaque marks the location of a beach house used by WA writer Tom Hungerford (1915-2011).
Tom Hungerford is remembered for his novels The Ridge and the River, set in the islands of Papua New Guinea during World War II, and Sowers of the Wind: A Novel of the Occupation of Japan.
He also wrote autobiographical works, Stories From Suburban Road, Knockabout with a Slouch Hat and Red Rover All Over published in one book called Straightshooter by the Fremantle Arts Centre Press.</groundspeak:long_description>

The Scarborough Clock Tower was unveiled in 1979 to commemorate WA’s 150th anniversary of European settlement, as well as Rotary International's 75th Anniversary, whose members at the time put forward the idea of the clock.
The very 70's design of the Clock Tower means the time can be seen from many angles:  Rotarian David Taggart, who owned Scarborough Pharmacy for 50 years, said Scarborough parents wanted a clock so their children would never have an excuse to be late home from a day at the beach.  
In 2017, the Clock Tower was moved west 7 metres during the multi million dollar foreshore redevelopment and is no longer at the centre of the roundabout.
It is on the WA State Register of Historical places</groundspeak:long_description>

King Road Brewing Co

This seems an unlikely spot for a craft brewery, being in the middle of nowhere, between Rockingham and Byford. It can get incredibly busy at the weekend on a nice sunny day. It boasts a selection of craft beers and ciders, a rustic restaurant and extensive grounds with a play area for the kids.</groundspeak:long_description>

Municipal Heritage Inventory -
It is mandatory under the Heritage of Western Australia Act 1990 for each local government
to maintain a Municipal Heritage Inventory (MHI). The Shire of Mundaring MHI lists many
places that contribute to the history and character of the local area and classifies them
according to the degree of significance. Modification of places on the MHI may not always
require planning approval, although sympathetic design is still recommended to maintain the
character and heritage values.

Trigg Island is a low wave-washed rocky islet that forms the northern boundary of the long Swanbourne to Trigg beaches. This northern part of the Perth coast was only developed in the 1950s, with the Trigg Island Surf Life Saving Club being established in 1954. In its first two years of operation it rescued 47 people from the more hazardous surf at this end of the beach.
The surf club patrols the northern 1.5 km of the beach including the infamous Blue Hole, a permanent rip that runs out on the south side of the island, and has been the scene of many rescues. Furthermore, like adjoining South Trigg and Scarborough beaches, waves are higher along Trigg Beach, and the continuous bar is more likely to be cut by rips and rip channels, making this one of the most hazardous beaches in the Perth region.</groundspeak:long_description>

Mettam's Pool is a very popular swimming spot in the northern beaches.  It is protected by a 50 to 100m wide platform reef and except on days of big swell or onshore winds, is a safer  place for families and swimmers of all ages, as well as a good snorkelling spot.
The Mettam family had a holiday house at nearby Trigg, one of the first to be built on what would come to be called Mettam Street, and lived there for 34 years.  In the 1940's, Frank Mettam and his family patiently removed the reef that bisected what was then called Lennards Pool piece by piece, using nothing but muscle and grit, and a few pickaxes. Lennards Pool was renamed Mettams Pool and promoted as a safe ocean swimming pool for children and the elderly. (West Australian, 10/9/2016)

The Centaur Wreck Memorial features a simple concrete bow and a plaque marking the direction of the Centaur wreck which lies approximately 2 kilometres directly out to sea in the Marmion Marine Park.
The Centaur was sunk after striking a reef (now called Centaur Reef) on 9 December 1874 while travelling from Champion Bay to Fremantle. All nine crew and four passengers, including noted politician and lawyer Septimus Burt, survived.
The 30 metre long brig, built in Aberdeen, Scotland in 1849, was carrying a cargo of 180 tonne of galena (lead ore) when it struck the reef.</groundspeak:long_description>

Quenda Habitat

Star Swamp bushland is habitat for the Quenda or Southern Brown Bandicoot.

As the Quenda is a species in decline, every effort is being made to protect it from threats and disturbances. These measures include Dieback quarantine, animal pest control, weed management, revegetation and protective fencing.

If you visit this area early morning or late afternoon, keep your eyes peeled and noise to a minimum and you may be lucky enough to spot one or two of these shy little creatures.

Municipal Heritage Inventory -
It is mandatory under the Heritage of Western Australia Act 1990 for each local government
to maintain a Municipal Heritage Inventory (MHI). The Shire of Mundaring MHI lists many
places that contribute to the history and character of the local area and classifies them
according to the degree of significance. Modification of places on the MHI may not always
require planning approval, although sympathetic design is still recommended to maintain the
character and heritage values.

Between 1834 and 1841 explorers and surveyors John Butler, George Grey, Thomas Watson and John  Septimus Roe visited the area now known as Wanneroo. The success of the Swan colony depended upon its ability to grow food so finding good arable land was vital. The first farms were set up around the shores of Lake Joondalup in the mid 1840s, with the Wesleyan Missionary Society setting up an experimental farm to be lived and worked on by Aboriginal people under the guidance of the church. Running at a loss with poor soil, failed crops and floods, the departure of overseer Frederick Waldeck led to the demise of the farm which subsequently moved out to York.

In 1852 Wanneroo finally became home to its first permanent settlers James and Mary-Ann Cockman. This adventure cache explores some of Wanneroo's pioneering history.

The start of this Lab Cache points to the Wanneroo Museum which is usually open 10am to 4pm Monday to Friday, 12pm to 4pm Saturday and 11am to 3pm on Sundays.

Della's Dairy Farm Site

Enrico Della-Marta arrived in Australia in 1924 aged 19. He initially worked in a gold mine near Gwalia (~233km north of Kalgoorlie) where he learnt to speak English. By 1925 he was working in Hotham felling trees before he took up dairy farming in Osborne Park. It was here that he met and married Ida. After 2-3 years he moved the cattle to Wanneroo where he leased the land for the dairy and subsequently purchased 500 acres. The dairy had about 100 heads of cattle but a TB outbreak reduced numbers by 20-30 over five years.
Between 1931 - 1945 the site also operated as a second unofficial post office and telephone exchange.
The dairy was subsequently leased by a Mr Duffy before being purchased by Giovanni Gava in the 1950s.

Little of the dairy still exists with only a few cow pens and small shed still standing but the recent addition of a shared pathway makes accessibility to the site straightforward.</groundspeak:long_description>

Cockman House

James Cockman (1809-1877) arrived in Australia in August 1829 from Gloucestershire, England - just 3 months after the colony was proclaimed. He married Mary-Anne Roper (1812-1901) on 15th March 1830 in the first Anglican wedding in the colony. In 1852 they moved to the area to set up a 45 acre dairy farm and market garden at the edge of Walluburnup Swamp.

The building we see today is their second home built approx 1860 by James and his son John. The first house was a wattle and daub construction known as the little house. It was burnt down after becoming vermin infested. James and John quarried, by hand, the limestone from outcrops on the eastern side of the lake. The timber was prepared in one of the Shenton saw mills.

James and Mary had 7 children and 4 generations lived here until it was purchased and restored by the City of Wanneroo in 1988.

The house is normally open Sundays 2pm-5pm (closed February) but you do not need to enter to answer the question.</groundspeak:long_description>

One of Western Australia’s oldest settlements, Jarrahdale is set in the Darling Range and surrounded by Jarrah forest. The town is only an hour south of Perth and thirty minutes from Armadale or Rockingham.
HISTORICALLY
In 1871, the Rockingham Jarrah Company was granted a lease of 250,000 acres of jarrah forest in the Darling Range. In 1872, the company built a sawmill in Jarrahdale, a jetty at Rockingham for loading the timber onto ships for export, and a railway line to connect them. The Jarrahdale to Rockingham train line was the second rail line in the colony and initially had wooden rails and a locomotive that averaged 20km/hour. The wooden rails were replaced with iron from 1878 - 1882, and they lasted till 1950. Jarrahdale was  the state's first major timber milling operation, and it played a key role in the development of W.A. through the exportation of jarrah around the world. In 1872, 8220 people lived in Perth, and over 300 lived and worked in Jarrahdale. Between 1893 and 1899.

Tools of the trade

 Eucalyptus marginata, commonly known as jarrah, djarraly in Noongar language  and historically as Swan River mahogany,  is a plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae and is endemic to the south-west of Western Australia. It is a tree with rough, fibrous bark, leaves with a distinct midvein, white flowers and relatively large, more or less spherical fruit. Its hard, dense timber is insect resistant although the tree is susceptible to dieback. The timber has been utilised for cabinet-making, flooring and railway sleepers.

Jarrah is a tree which sometimes grows to a height of 40 m (100 ft) high with a trunk up to 3 m (10 ft) in diameter.

One of Western Australia’s oldest settlements, Jarrahdale is set in the Darling Range and surrounded by Jarrah forest. The town is only an hour south of Perth and thirty minutes from Armadale or Rockingham.
HISTORICALLY
In 1871, the Rockingham Jarrah Company was granted a lease of 250,000 acres of jarrah forest in the Darling Range. In 1872, the company built a sawmill in Jarrahdale, a jetty at Rockingham for loading the timber onto ships for export, and a railway line to connect them. The Jarrahdale to Rockingham train line was the second rail line in the colony and initially had wooden rails and a locomotive that averaged 20km/hour. The wooden rails were replaced with iron from 1878 - 1882, and they lasted till 1950. Jarrahdale was  the state's first major timber milling operation, and it played a key role in the development of W.A. through the exportation of jarrah around the world. In 1872, 8220 people lived in Perth, and over 300 lived and worked in Jarrahdale. Between 1893 and 1899.

   <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Hillarys was named after an early settler, Bertram John Hillary (1895-1957), who had become blind in his right eye while fighting in Gallipoli during the First World War. He came to the area during the Great Depression while fishing for a living with his brother Harry, and built a boatshed on the beach in 1930. Subsequently, he expanded it to accommodate himself, his wife and four children. For many years, they were the only residents of what is now Hillarys, and the nearest store, at North Beach to the south, was a 5 km walk away. During the Second World War, the Australian Army used the area, and named it "Hillary's Beach" on their maps. Bert Hillarys died in 1957 and the shack and 14 others nearby were destroyed in a fierce storm in 1964.

Between 1834 and 1841 explorers and surveyors John Butler, George Grey, Thomas Watson and John  Septimus Roe visited the area now known as Wanneroo. The success of the Swan colony depended upon its ability to grow food so finding good arable land was vital. The first farms were set up around the shores of Lake Joondalup in the mid 1840s, with the Wesleyan Missionary Society setting up an experimental farm to be lived and worked on by Aboriginal people under the guidance of the church. Running at a loss with poor soil, failed crops and floods, the departure of overseer Frederick Waldeck led to the demise of the farm which subsequently moved out to York.

In 1852 Wanneroo finally became home to its first permanent settlers James and Mary-Ann Cockman. This adventure cache explores some of Wanneroo's pioneering history.

The start of this Lab Cache points to the Wanneroo Museum which is usually open 10am to 4pm Monday to Friday, 12pm to 4pm Saturday and 11am to 3pm on Sundays.

Perry's Paddock

Originally known as Shenton Park, Perry's Paddock was renamed by John (Jack) Perry who purchased 1300 acres from the Shenton Estate in 1912. The Perry family operated a horse breaking and stock dealing business here from 1912 to 1929.

Between 1915 and 1930, Wanneroo Picnic Race Days were held here annually. This community event was one of the highlights of the year and consisted of foot races in the morning and horse racing in the afternoon. Lunch was served under the shade of the large trees to the north. The last race day occurred in 1930 after which the WA Turf Club refused permission for racing and betting at Perry's Paddock.

From the 1930s the paddock was used as a market garden by the Hastings and then Duffy families.

Race days were re-introduced between 1992 and 2001.

Perry's cottage dates from around 1850 and was known as Linhay. The stables are reduced to a pile of rubble. The second building, the bunkhouse, was reconstructed in the 1990s but it</groundspeak:long_description>

Millbrook Winnery

A stunning location in a tranquil setting. No need to go beyond the gates but it would be a pity to come all this way and not venture further.
Millbrook is a boutique winery and restaurant in the historic town of Jarrahdale in Western Australia, 50 minutes south-east of Perth. The winery is located at the picturesque Chestnut Farm, a property that backs on to the Serpentine River and is nestled among jarrah forests, with stunning vistas of the rolling landscape.

The origins of Chestnut Farm date back to the 19th century, when the original owner, Joseph Batt, planted an orchard and the first grapevines in 1865, providing fruit to the local

In 1872, the company built a sawmill in Jarrahdale, a jetty at Rockingham for loading the timber onto ships for export, and a railway line to connect them. The Jarrahdale to Rockingham train line was the second rail line in the colony and initially had wooden rails and a locomotive that averaged 20km/hour. The wooden rails were replaced with iron from 1878 - 1882, and they lasted till 1950. Jarrahdale was  the state's first major timber milling operation, and it played a key role in the development of W.A. through the exportation of jarrah around the world. In 1872, 8220 people lived in Perth, and over 300 lived and worked in Jarrahdale. Between 1893 and 1899.

Tuart

Eucalyptus gomphocephala, known as Tuart, is a species of tree, one of the six forest giants of Southwest Australia. Tuart forest was common on the Swan coastal plain, until the valuable trees were felled for export and displaced by the urban development around Perth.

A 350year old Tuart is not far from here amongst the trees in the Settlers Walk. It is in a park off Rankin Meander and has a circumference of 7.70 metres</groundspeak:long_description>

Buds

The Tuart trees in Baldivis drop buds everywhere. There are a few on the ground right here (albeit, these ones are a bit bigger)
You will see them in various stages here.

Tuarts grow up to 40 metres high. Its rough, fibrous grey bark flakes into small pieces. The leaves are often curved, 90 to 160 millimetres long, and are a shiny light green above and paler below. The almost stalkless buds cluster in groups of seven. Tuart buds are very distinctive; they have swollen bud caps and are shaped like small ice cream cones. Each bud cap is eight to 10 millimetres long and the species name refers to this feature - ‘gompho’ (club) and ‘cephala’ (head).</groundspeak:long_description>

Gondi the Gecko

Our family have always called this the "Gecko Park" after Gondi and as younger boys, would often play all over him.
I think the biological name on the plaque is the coolest thing and I recon an early option of "doyathinkisaurus" was laughed out so they compromised with "Underwoodisaurus" and tried to pass it off as being named after British herpetologist, Garth Leon Underwood.

While you are reading the plaque, you will need some information off it.</groundspeak:long_description>

This Steel sculpture was purchased in 2017 and placed with the opening of the dog park in  2018.

With 3000m2 for your four legged friends, separated into two areas, this is a great space to let the dogs off and have a run.

Welcome to Cape Peron, or as we know it locally, Point Peron.

Point Peron holds great significance for the Whadjuk people, the traditional owners of the area, whose family groups would travel through the region utilising seasonal resources.  It is still a special place for them to preserve their Aboriginal ties and traditions.

Point Peron was named after French Zoologist and Naturalist, François Péron who accompanied Commodore Nicholas Baudin on his expedition along the western coast of Australia in 1801.
From 1942-1945 (during WWII) Point Peron was the site of the "K" Battery complex .  This battery complex was one of a chain of coastal gun placements defending the Perth region from Swanbourne, in the north to Cape Peron in the south.

The area is well known for its protected beaches, limestone cliffs, great snorkelling, diving, fishing and scenic views. 

We hope you enjoy this Adventure Lab along this beautiful coastline.

John Point

"In the Spotlight"
Two Coastal Artillery Searchlight (CASLs) were established once the Peron Battery was commissioned.  They were controlled by a Director Electric Control which enabled them to be operated from John Point and Mushroom Rock.  Whilst dark the searchlights were manned from dawn to dusk and were the Battery's 'eyes'.
An anti-submarine boom fence began construction in 1943 as a part of the strategy to prevent passage of enemy ships or midget submarines.  This was also constructed across the southern entrances in the approximate area where the Causeway Bridge now links Point Peron to Garden Island.</groundspeak:long_description>

Peron Battery Observation Post

This is the highest point on the Cape and offers spectacular views of the coastline and the Shoalwater Marine Park.
Point Peron was once an integral part of the coastal defence or Western Australia during WWII.  Once the Japanese attacked Darwin Harbour there was an urgent need to strengthen the defences of Australia.  This battery was last in one of a string of heavy coastal batteries up to Swanbourne which also included Garden and Rottnest Islands.  Thankfully none of this artillery was used in battle.  The battery was decommissioned in December 1944.

Welcome to Cape Peron, or as we know it locally, Point Peron.

Point Peron holds great significance for the Whadjuk people, the traditional owners of the area, whose family groups would travel through the region utilising seasonal resources.  It is still a special place for them to preserve their Aboriginal ties and traditions.

Point Peron was named after French Zoologist and Naturalist, François Péron who accompanied Commodore Nicholas Baudin on his expedition along the western coast of Australia in 1801.
From 1942-1945 (during WWII) Point Peron was the site of the "K" Battery complex .  This battery complex was one of a chain of coastal gun placements defending the Perth region from Swanbourne, in the north to Cape Peron in the south.

The area is well known for its protected beaches, limestone cliffs, great snorkelling, diving, fishing and scenic views. 

We hope you enjoy this Adventure Lab along this beautiful coastline. 

Don't forget to take note of the clues for the bonus cache GC8Z7VQ!

Between 1834 and 1841 explorers and surveyors John Butler, George Grey, Thomas Watson and John  Septimus Roe visited the area now known as Wanneroo. The success of the Swan colony depended upon its ability to grow food so finding good arable land was vital. The first farms were set up around the shores of Lake Joondalup in the mid 1840s, with the Wesleyan Missionary Society setting up an experimental farm to be lived and worked on by Aboriginal people under the guidance of the church. Running at a loss with poor soil, failed crops and floods, the departure of overseer Frederick Waldeck led to the demise of the farm which subsequently moved out to York.

In 1852 Wanneroo finally became home to its first permanent settlers James and Mary-Ann Cockman. This adventure cache explores some of Wanneroo's pioneering history.

The start of this Lab Cache points to the Wanneroo Museum which is usually open 10am to 4pm Monday to Friday, 12pm to 4pm Saturday and 11am to 3pm on Sundays.

Bortolo (Bert) Togno

Bert Togno Park in Wanneroo is named after Bortolo (Bert) Togno (1894 - 1987). Bert arrived in Australia in 1911 and originally settled in Cranbrook and worked as a shearer for Synott and Dunbar, later becoming a dairy farmer in Wanneroo. After returning to Italy and marrying Maria Pollette, he returned to WA. They had 4 children - Erica, Zelia, Frank and Alex.

Local history notes that he lived at Buckingham House and sometime between the 1940s and 50s they added windows to the south side of the property and the verandah.

Bert Togno park contains a path with wall of honour commemorating the settler families of Wanneroo which show many familiar names later attributed to roads, parks and suburbs in the Wanneroo surrounds.</groundspeak:long_description>

Wanneroo

31.3km by road from Perth

In the early days of the Swan River Colony, the district of Wanneroo represented an "outer" region and it is not until 1834, that an excursion into the area by any explorers or settlers is recorded. In that year, a party of four led by John Butler, travelled about 35 miles north from Perth to search for lost cattle and passed through the area just to the east of Lake Joondalup. Butler stated that the aborigines of the area were "those wanneroo men who frequent Perth in company with the Yellowgonga tribe." It is not known when early settlers started using the name "Wanneroo", but, as early as 1842, a Surveyor recorded "road to Wanneroo" and in 1844, James Dobbins gave his address as Wanneroo. A government townsite was gazetted as "Wanneru", an Aboriginal word referring to the sticks used by women for digging roots, in August 1907 and it was not until May 1953 that the spelling was amended to "Wanneroo".

Buckingham House and Old School Room

Buckingham House
John Buckingham arrived in the Swan River Colony in 1850 aboard "Sophia" with his wife and two children. John Buckingham Jnr married Emily Amelia Okley and had 5 children. He purchased 100 acres of land in 1876 around Lake Joondalup and built the house sometime in the 1880s. The house was leased by dairy farmers including William Tapping (1846-1935) and his wife Mary in 1899.  The Shire of Wanneroo purchased the house in 1975 and today it runs as a heritage education centre for local primary school children.

Old Wanneroo Schoolroom - is a combination of two school rooms. Wanneroo school was originally located on the corner of Dundebar &amp; Wanneroo Rds. The larger section dates from 1899 and the smaller section was added in 1928 due to increased numbers of children at the East Wanneroo school (relocated from Jandabup). It has been moved 3 further times including in 1992 to Perry's Paddock as part of the city's collection of heritage buildings. In 2009 it was moved to the current

The Graduate

Not technically part of the Joondalup public art collection, this bronze sculpture at the entrance to the WA Police training academy is worth checking out anyway.  The life-size figure was originally modelled in clay before being cast in bronze, the whole process taking around 12 months.

'The Graduate' was created by father and son duo Tony Jones and Ben Jones, who, individually and together are the artists responsible for some of WA's interesting and iconic public art, the most notable being the bronze sculpture 'Eliza' in the Swan River.  Others include the bronze sculpture life guards at Scarborough beach, and C. Y. O'Connor and his horse in the surf at Coogee.</groundspeak:long_description>

Whitelakes Brewing

Take an easy 40-minute drive south from the Perth CBD and you’ll find Whitelakes Brewing, created via a substantial makeover to the Old Barnyard function centre in Baldivis and launched in July 2016.
Located on a vast corner block, the building's modern glass, steel and wood stylings hold a small bar area within the brewhouse. The alfresco deck looks across a large lawn – typically filled with families on the weekends – to Lake Walyungup, the inspiration for the brewery’s name and artwork.
Despite the saline appearance of the protected wetlands, the "white lakes" are actually fresh water, with the illusion the result of a limestone cap beginning at the lakes and running south more than 200 kilometres to Yallingup. It’s a vista that provides a unique backdrop – often complete with stunning sunsets</groundspeak:long_description>

Bibulman Yorga

Ron Corbett is an Aboriginal artist born in 1956.  He created the bronze artwork 'Bibulman Yorga', which was installed at Neil Hawkins Park in 1998.

The piece is a life-size sculpture of an Aboriginal woman and her dog, who represent the traditional owners of the Joondalup region.

Ron Corbett's other public art includes the Indigenous inspired images at the eastern end of the Northbridge Tunnel.

Take the time to enjoy Neil Hawkins park while you are here.

Metal Trees

Metal Trees was created as part of a 'National Metal Industry’ public art project in 1994.

In Western Australia, Kevin Draper was selected to work from the Transfield workshops at Garden Island to create the artwork.  The sculptures were originally located at Joondalup Arena, but a major redevelopment of the sporting complex resulted in them being relocated to Joondalup's Central Park in 2002.

Albany artist Kevin Draper has a number of art pieces throughout Perth and the South West, which are often made of steel and worked metal.</groundspeak:long_description>

War Memorial

The war memorial in Joondalup was created by Joan Walsh-Smith and Charles Smith on behalf the
Wanneroo – Joondalup Returned and Services, and the 10 metre high memorial and bronze statue here was unveiled on ANZAC day in 1996.

The top of the memorial is a semi-circular window through which the rising sun shines.  It is inscribed with the words, ‘Those only deserve freedom who are prepared to defend it’. The sculptors describe the boy with the poppy as "a symbol of the innocence of children and the desire for world peace".

Originally from Ireland, Smith Sculptors are a husband and wife team who, along with their daughter, specialise in large public art projects in Western Australia, Australia, and internationally. The team is responsible for some of the iconic memorials and public art in WA, such as the Kangaroos on St Georges Terrace, Percy Button (the street entertainer doing a handstand) in the Hay Street Mall, and the HMAS Sydney memorial in Geraldton.</groundspeak:long_description>

This art trail explores some of the early public art installed in Joondalup when the suburb was being developed.  Most of the art has been specifically commissioned by the City of Joondalup, but many of the institutions in the area have also installed public art worth visiting.

If you have time, a walk or cycle is the best way to explore the area.  You could visit the locations in either a clockwise or anticlockwise direction, and enjoy the art, scenery and bushland on the way.cache (GC8XH3E) that is also in keeping with the theme.

Bronze Plaques

Steve Tepper created this series of 15 pairs of bronze plaques, which were installed here in 1998.  You will find the plaques incorporated in the columns along the Joondalup Library and Civic Centre underpass.

Each pair of plaques can be found installed opposite each other.  All but one pair is the positive and negative cast of each other, which represent early domestic life in the Joondalup area.

Steve Tepper has many other public art installations all around Perth, a favourite of which is the octopus at Heathcote playground.</groundspeak:long_description>

Peel Estate Wines

Peel Estate Wines has been an integral part of the Peel Region for over 40 years. In 1973 the first Shiraz vines were planted, followed by Chenin Blanc and Zinfandel in 1976, and Cabernet Sauvignon in 1979. Other varieties such as Chardonnay, Verdelho, Cabernet Franc and the traditional Portuguese Port Varieties were planted in 1980.

The Peel region with its close proximity to the Indian Ocean is the ideal location to grow wine grapes as it combines unique coastal limestone soils and a Mediterranean climate, ensuring wines with fruit intensity along with specific regional

It is approximately 3km from one end to the other with a suggested route attached to the Bonus Box - GC8YQKG. This route keeps it fairly flat and gives you a nosey at the posh houses.

Osprey Nesting 

Breeding season for Osprey is June/July and they like to create their nests (or stacks) on rocky ledges or high vantage points. You can see a man-made helping hand from this location but rest assured the Osprey are responsible for making it a home.

Please be aware the locations for this Adventure Lab are quite a distance from the map marker, make sure you check your nearest Lab point before commencing.

The metropolitan Perth rail network is comprised of five major lines connecting the four Metropolitan Development Corridors and Fremantle to the Perth CBD.

Over the coming years the network is set to expand even further to accomade travelers from Ellenbrook, Forrestfield and extending lines past Armadale to Byford and continuing north to Yanchep.

This Adventure Lab will take you on a tour of the various lines of the Perth Rail Network. You are more than welcome to catch the trains to the stops (it can be done in a single day) if you wish but this is not a requirement, in fact all information can be gained and answered without entering the stations themselves.

This Adventure Lab cache is designed to get people out and about exploring Mandurah and the marine environment it has long been renowned for. The downtown tourist precinct seems to be forever evolving with new things to be discovered each time you wander around. Fortunately there are lots of places to stop, grab a bite to eat or something to drink before continuing on your way.

Please be prepared to spend a little bit of time on these ones with three of them having a fairly simple puzzle of some sort for you to solve. Hopefully, you will bring a pen and paper with you, your thinking caps and of course your cameras, for all the photo opportunities along the way.

This can easily be completed within a day or you could rush and do it in a few hours, however I recommend you take your time and explore the area and take in some of Western Australia's early history.  Some parts might have you thinking about the early European passengers who thought they were heading to Batavia (Jakarta) but ended up being shipwrecked on what is now the beautiful northern beaches of Perth.

It is best completed from south to north, however it can be completed in any order you like, parking is readily available at all points or for the fitter geocachers a bicycle ride is quite doable.

Keep a close eye on your answers at each stage, because there might be a "Bonus Box" (GC8ANQJ) published.

At the waypoint you will find a plaque describing the wreck and the details of its demise, it has been a much talked about and written about wreck with one great book by a local, to Perth, Jack Wong Sue.

A lot of talk about the wreck being haunted and the book is a fascinating read indeed.  Certainly some other great videos worth a look at if this history interests you, it certainly did me.  And I have very fond memories of 4 X 4 driving through the area back in the 1980's and 90's when the wreck was a lot lot more visible than it is today.

Hope you have enjoyed stage 1 of this Adventure Lab</groundspeak:long_description>

Please be aware the locations for this Adventure Lab are quite a distance from the map marker, make sure you check your nearest Lab point before commencing.

The metropolitan Perth rail network is comprised of five major lines connecting the four Metropolitan Development Corridors and Fremantle to the Perth CBD.

Over the coming years the network is set to expand even further to accomade travelers from Ellenbrook, Forrestfield and extending lines past Armadale to Byford and continuing north to Yanchep.

This Adventure Lab will take you on a tour of the various lines of the Perth Rail Network. You are more than welcome to catch the trains to the stops (it can be done in a single day) if you wish but this is not a requirement, in fact all information can be gained and answered without entering the stations themselves.

This Adventure Lab cache is designed to get people out and about exploring Mandurah and the marine environment it has long been renowned for. The downtown tourist precinct seems to be forever evolving with new things to be discovered each time you wander around. Fortunately there are lots of places to stop, grab a bite to eat or something to drink before continuing on your way.

Please be prepared to spend a little bit of time on these ones with three of them having a fairly simple puzzle of some sort for you to solve. Hopefully, you will bring a pen and paper with you, your thinking caps and of course your cameras, for all the photo opportunities along the way.

3D Pavement Artwork

Various locations around Mandurah have been transformed into tourism drawcards, aimed at creating additional photo opportunities for visitors and locals alike.

The pavement outside the Mandurah Visitor Centre on Mandurah Terrace boasts a remarkable depiction of the Peel-Harvey Estuary. Visit Mandurah commissioned Australia’s most highly awarded pavement artist, Jenny McCracken, to create this impressive 3D illusion for people to pose with.

If you stand at the spot from where the featured photo was taken, you can find the information you need to log this location's Adventure Lab cache.

PS Another of Jenny McCracken's artworks can be viewed and enjoyed at the Eastern End of the New Mandurah Traffic Bridge where the initial adventure lab icon is indicating, so you might like to go and check it out before leaving town.

PPS There is a hint on the image for the first puzzle, but here is another: M = V</groundspeak:long_description>

Directional signs

On all trails you will find small triangles acting as an arrow to keep you on the right path and heading in the correct direction.  Quite often with a specific pattern or design, lots of these were destroyed in the last bushfire, the design on this trail is the Xanthorrhoea australis or commonly known as a "black boy" or the more politically correct title of a grass tree.  However I am advised that many indigenous locals have always referred to them as black boys!

Meeting Place

Inside the main area of the park is a great place to see many of the Western Grey kangaroos grazing on the lawns and around the golf course.  If you're lucky you may catch a flock of the endangered Carnaby black-cockatoos and in the late winter early spring some great blooms of wild flowers.  Keep your eyes open!

A good place to start

The start of the trail from Yanchep Beach Road, this photo was taken on the 19th December 2019 just after the road had been opened after the horrendous bush fires of that year.  Note the amount of re-growth that has started after the winter rains

At GZ you will find an outstanding mosaic mural, which is quite stunning.

Fisherman's Hollow together with Yanchep Lagoon have been frequented by holiday makers and fishermen since the early 1900s. In 1926 Mary Lindsay purchased approximately 23,000 acres of land along the coast in the approximate location of Two Rocks. This became known as Yanchep Estate. A timber framed
homestead was constructed in the area north of Brazier Road and west of Two Rocks Road. This
has been totally renovated and is now an art studio/gallery and is your next visit on this adventure.

The hollow is still used as a popular picnic spot by locals and tourists and it has BBQ facilities and is an ideal spot to relax or kick a ball of walk your dog.  An ideal spot for Geocaching events and I have held 2 here</groundspeak:long_description>

At this location, you will be standing outside the entrance to the newly renovated Mary Lindsey Cottage, in front of the plaque where you will find the answer to allow you to move on.  BUT before you do I suggest it is well worth a read of the history of this extraordinary woman and if you time you visit well, have a visit to the gallery and a chat with some of the volunteers who look after the place now it has been redeveloped.

FRIDAY is OPEN STUDIO 10am - 3pm Everyone is welcome to visit the studio, bring a project to work on or drop in for a coffee and a chat or look at the art work.
SUNDAY, the Gallery is OPEN to the public from 11am - 3pm. ALL WELCOME</groundspeak:long_description>

Here you will find a nice new plaque with good description of the wreck, I had thought this might require a much further walk out to the point where the original plaque is.  It is still there but starting to corrode rather badly. 

The cover photo for this was taken last year after the winds and storms had uncovered the wreck and this shows the old plaque in the distance.  Do not go down to the wreck site, as there is now a Permanent Conservation Order on the wreck now, however you can get great views form the hill not too far of a walk from GZ, or from the old plaque</groundspeak:long_description>

At this point you will find a plaque with a story of one of the first shipwrecks on the WA coast.  I think this raises some interesting questions or thoughts as to what happened to the survivors or the original wreck!

Some great rock formations here, and if you wonder down to the beach you can see where the name Two Rocks comes from.

Worth a visit up to the shopping centre at Two Rock and the old car park for Atlantis the old water theme park and the statue of King Neptune.  Also full of interesting history, and could be another Adventure Lab Cache, if more get given out.

Toodyay

88.3km by road from Perth

The townsite of Toodyay is located on the Avon River in the central agricultural region. It is one of the earliest inland towns in the state, and was surveyed in 1833 following the settlement of the Avon region. However, the townsite's location on the Avon was subject to flooding, and in 1860 an alternative site about 5 km higher up the Avon was gazetted as a townsite and named Newcastle (probably named after the Duke of Newcastle, Secretary of State 1853).

In 1909 the Prime Minister wrote to the state government requesting consideration be given to changing the name of Newcastle because of duplication with Newcastle in New South Wales. The Prime Minister suggested the name Toodyay be considered. The Newcastle Municipality at first opposed the change, but following a referendum of residents the name change to Toodyay was supported. The change was gazetted in May 1910, and at the same time the Toodyay townsite was renamed West Toodyay.

Welcome to York, the first and therefore the oldest inland town in Western Australia.  This delightful country town is situated on the Avon River on Ballardong Nyoongar land.  Within an hour's drive from Perth, York provides an escape to a place bursting with natural, cultural and historical hidden gems.
The Adventure Lab will take you for a casual stroll on an easy circuit to places of significant historical interest including locations with links to the town's convict past.
Although the locations can be visited in any order, a good place to start would be the Swing Bridge where there is ample parking and conveniences,
Please note that several of the places of interest are privately owned and the required information can be found on plaques adjacent to the footpaths.

York Swing Bridge

The first bridge over the Avon River was built by convicts in 1853 but the bridge has been rebuilt several times over the ensuing years. This existing suspension bridge was built in 1988 to a modified design that addresses relevant safety concerns.  There is a plaque near the western side of the bridge that will provide you with more information.</groundspeak:long_description>

Holy Trinity Church

Built in 1854, and consecrated in 1858, the Holy Trinity Church was the second Anglican Church to be built in York.  The building was designed by architect Richard Jewell in the style of 11th century Victorian Romanesque. A replica of the original foundation stone can be found on the eastern side of the building.</groundspeak:long_description>

The Old Hospital

This Old York Hospital was built on the site of the York Convict Depot in 1894 ( replacing the first York Hospital) from the designs of architect George Temple-Poole. The building is said to be haunted complete with terrifying stories of paranormal encounters from very 'credible witnesses'.  Fortunately, you can get all the information you need from the York Heritage Trail plaque in front of the building.</groundspeak:long_description>

Kairey Cottage

This Colonial mudbrick cottage was built in 1859 and is York's last surviving Pensioner Cottage. Pensioner guards were granted land in York for services guarding convicts on the voyage to Australia. This cottage is typical of the era and boasts well kept gardens and outbuildings. A York Heritage Trail plaque on the verge in front of the cottage provides more detailed information.</groundspeak:long_description>

The Residency Museum

The museum was originally part of York's Convict Hiring Depot and was built in the 1850's.  It was built as the Depot Superintendent's Quarters and is the last remaining part of the York Convict Depot.  As a museum, it now provides a fascinating insight into the history of the region. Even if it is closed, there are information panels and old relics of bygone eras on display outside. On the front wall, there is also a brass plaque sponsored by Nicholas Hasluck, a retired judge and poet who has a home in York.</groundspeak:long_description>

Beverley is a wheatbelt town 130km east of Perth on the Avon River. Founded in 1838, Beverley is one of Western Australia’s oldest settlements.

The town is lucky to play host to well known artist James Giddy who visited in June 2017. He painted animals throughout the town centre, in a medium known as ‘en plain air’, simply translated to painting ‘in open air’.

This adventure lab takes you on a journey of his brilliant murals leaving a lasting mark on Vincent Street.

Stop and have a coffee at one of the cafes and explore the railway station art gallery. The skate park and playground should be a hit for the kids.

You will collect a letter from four of the locations and a suffix containing 5 characters at another. This clue will be the code required for the bonus box.  The BB is a short walk to the east of the murals. I would start the adventure at the fountain.

Beverley District Centenary Fountain

At times, the water in this fountain is a very blue colour. The fountain commemorates the centenary of the local government in the Beverley District.

The official survey of the Beverley district occurred in 1843.

Carefully read the plaque on the fountain.

Giddy’s use of bold, painterly brushstrokes compliment the natural subjects and bring attention to his chosen medium.

Bunbury

173.7km by road from Perth.

The City of Bunbury is named in honour of Lieutenant Henry William St. Pierre Bunbury (1812-1875) of the 21st Fusiliers. Bunbury carried out explorations in this area in 1836, and in a book of his letters and papers published in 1930 he wrote of Bunbury " A township has been formed, or at least laid down on the maps, comprising the southern promontory and part of the north beach at the entrance of Port Leschenault Inlet, which the Governor named "Bunbury" in compliment to me......"
In 1830 Lt Governor Stirling caused a military station to be established at Port Leschenault under the command of Lt McLeod, but it only lasted six months. Bunbury township was mentioned in the Government Gazette in 1839, but lots in the town were not surveyed until 1841, and these were declared open for selection in March 1841.

This Adventure Lab can easily be completed within a day, however I would recommend you take your time and explore the area and take in some of Busselton's Cultural and Early Historical Locations.

   <groundspeak:long_description html="False">he Jetty

The original section of the Busselton Jetty was constructed in 1865, it is culturally significant as an early West Australian timber structure and a valuable relic of Busselton's early days, with the connection to the bustling timber industry.
It is the longest Wooden Jetty constructed in the Southern Hemisphere.
Cylcone Alby wreaked a trail of devastation in April 1978, completely destroying the Promenade. 
After a subsequent fire at the end of the jetty, damage closed the far end.
A Jetty Preservation Committee was set up and restoration projects have been carried out to what it is today.
The Underwater Observatory Showcases the stunning underwater environment, the corals, the fish and as an added bonus, you maybe privileged to see a Mermaid swimming by.
There are more development plans in action and should be finished by the end of 2020.
A stroll out on the Jetty to see the locals and tourists fishing and jetty jumping, enjoying the experience is wonderful.

There is a plaque at GZ.</groundspeak:long_description>

A Meander from the Iconic Busselton Jetty, along the scenic Foreshore, down through the Cultural Centre of town towards some Local Historical Buildings.

Geographe Bay was named in May 1801 by the French Explorer Nicolas Baudin, he named the Bay after his ship, the 'Geographe'.
Busselton was settled in the early 1830's by the Bussell family, George Layman and the Chapman Brothers.

This Adventure Lab can easily be completed within a day, however I would recommend you take your time and explore the area and take in some of Busselton's Cultural and Early Historical Locations.

There are plenty of stories to read along the way, depicting the Early Farming Settlements, the Pioneers and their Livelihoods from the Pioneering Days.

Geraldton

414.6km by road from Perth

The largest city in Western Australia north of Perth. The city is located on Champion Bay, discovered by Commander D Dring in the colonial schooner "Champion" in January 1840. The bay was named by the Royal Navy hydrographic surveyor, J L Stokes, who surveyed it later in 1840.

The Geraldton area was first explored by George Grey in 1839. In 1848 copper and lead were discovered on the Murchison River. The first exports of ore from the Murchison mines was made from Champion Bay in 1849, and soon after in 1850 surveyor Augustus Gregory was instructed to survey a townsite at this place.

On June 3 1851 the townsite of Geraldton was declared. The name was most probably given by Surveyor-General J.S. Roe, and honours the colony's Governor at that time, Captain Charles Fitzgerald.

Nearby to the city is the Mumbida Wind Farm.  Find the plaque dedicated to the opening of the wind farm.</groundspeak:long_description>

Most thought they were on a great adventure.  Instead, they were fighting a conflict that many would not return from.
This Adventure will take you to a number of locations around our beautiful city which pay tribute to those who fought for our freedom. 'As the sun rises and goes down, we will remember them'.

Pier of Remembrance

Peace Park was opened in 2010 and it is designed to commemorate the departure to the war front of soldiers who served in the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps (ANZAC) during WW1.

The features of the park include: a memorial wall, pier of remembrance, interpretive signage, lighting, landscaping, pathways and seating. 
A small area of the garden has been planted with Aleppo Pines, the same tree as found on Lone Pine Ridge in Gallipoli, providing a living connection between Albany and Gallipoli.

Albany

414.8km by road from Perth

The City of Albany, located on the south coast of Western Australia, was officially named by Governor Stirling at the beginning of 1832. It is named after Frederick, the Duke of Albany and York, and the favourite son of King George III. The city is located on King George Sound which was discovered and named "King George the Third's Sound" on 28th September, 1791, by Captain Vancouver.

Albany was the site of the first settlement in W.A. when Major Edmund Lockier of the 57th Regiment, under instructions from the N.S.W. Govt. hoisted the British Flag on 21.1.1827 on the site of "The Residency".

The city was more often referred to as King George Sound or King George's Sound for about the first 40 years of settlement. Portion of it was originally named "Fredrickstown" by Major Lockyer in 1827 in honour of the Duke of York and Albany, Commander in Chief of the British Army. This name disappeared about 1831 and the name Albany was retained for the whole town.

The Nullarbor Plain
As you travel across it’s windblown, barren surface you might feel more like you have left earth and are traversing the surface of another planet.
Crossing this huge plain is a quintessential Australian road trip experience and the incredible vast landscapes will make you feel in awe of the wonderful Country we are traveling across.
The name Nullarbor comes from the Latin word “nullus” meaning “nothing” and the word “arbor” meaning “tree”.
Wombats, emus and kangaroos call the Nullarbor home.
Can you imagine driving for 146.6km in a completely straight line, without a single bend or turn in the road? The Eyre Highway is where you will find this curve-free road, stretching between Caiguna and Balladonia.
As you drive across the Nullarbor Plain, you could play 18 holes of golf along the world’s longest golf course – the Nullarbor Links.
Now as you drive across the Nularbor Plain, you can add Australia's longest Adventure Lab to your journey.

Norseman Links

The Tin Camels in Norseman are a tribute to the early camel trains that carried freight to and from the town.

Camel teams were a common sight in and around Norseman at the turn of the century. Not only were they favored by prospectors but they were also much involved with the installation and upkeep of the East-West telegraph line, undertaking maintenance patrols well into the 1920s. Camels also transported household goods and mining equipment, and played a major role in the fledgling wool industry on the Nullarbor Plain hauling wagon loads from inland stations to the coast of Israelite Bay or to the rail-head in Norseman.

The Nullarbor Plain
As you travel across it’s windblown, barren surface you might feel more like you have left earth and are traversing the surface of another planet.
Crossing this huge plain is a quintessential Australian road trip experience and the incredible vast landscapes will make you feel in awe of the wonderful Country we are traveling across.
The name Nullarbor comes from the Latin word “nullus” meaning “nothing” and the word “arbor” meaning “tree”.
Wombats, emus and kangaroos call the Nullarbor home.
Can you imagine driving for 146.6km in a completely straight line, without a single bend or turn in the road? The Eyre Highway is where you will find this curve-free road, stretching between Caiguna and Balladonia.
As you drive across the Nullarbor Plain, you could play 18 holes of golf along the world’s longest golf course – the Nullarbor Links.
Now as you drive across the Nularbor Plain, you can add Australia's longest Adventure Lab to your journey.

Balladonia Links

Balladonia Station, encompassing the original hotel site became pastoral land in 1879 when 2 pioneers, Steve Ponton and John Sharp settled in the vicinity with a spirit to match their tough remote selection.
In the same year, their first wool clip reached the coast, 130kms south. 
Wagons pulled by teams of horses made the arduous journey to Israelite Bay, where the bales were loaded on to ships for export.

Border Links

The Border - At Border Village there is a Line marking the Border between Western Australia and South Australia, as it crosses the Highway at 60 degress.
Eucla is 87 m above sea level and located just 11 km from the South Australian border on the eastern edge of Western Australia. It is 1429 km east of Perth via the Great Western and Eyre Highways;  710 km east of Norseman; 491 km west of Ceduna and 1265 km west of Adelaide.
The old Telegraph Station at Eucla is one of the iconic and lonely images of the Nullarbor.
It is now nothing more than a few old stone walls slowly disappearing under huge white sand dunes on the edge of the Great Australian Bight.
A reminder of the isolated nature of this harsh environment and the way nature will always win against humans. Today, apart from the Telegraph Station there are the ruins of the old jetty on the coastline.
The Time - it will be different when you cross the Border.

Penong Links

Penong is a wonderful little town on the eastern end of the Nullarbor.
The township of Penong is a small wheatbelt settlement on the western edge of South Australia's wheatbelt which is characterised by dozens of windmills which pump the local water supply from a large underground basin, the Anjutabie water Basin.
Around the back of the town on the northern side, the historical society has been busy restoring an amazing number of old windmills, some with their history is documented on the information boards.
The Large Comet Windmill has a colourful history and is now well preserved.
The town and the surrounding district is so dry that the underground water is supplemented by rain water and water which is carted by truck from a reticulated water supply connected to the Tod River pipeline some 15 kilometres east of Penong.

The first recorded European to land on Broome shores was explorer William Dampier aboard his ship the HMS Roebuck.
The town was founded in 1883 as a port for the pearling industry and was named after the then Governor of WA – Sir Frederick Broome.
Although today, Broome is famous for it's beautiful pearls, originally Broome made it's name from the shells - not the pearls. From the 1880's, mother of pearl (the shell) was used to make buttons, cutlery handles, inlays and other ornate objects but with the introduction of plastic in the 1900's, mother of pearl became too expensive to use. The local economy collapsed and it would take until the mid 1950's before the pearl industry was revitalised and since has developed into the booming industry it has become.
This historic pearling town in now one of the most favourite holiday destinations in the country.

Japanese Cemetery

In the latter part of the 19th and the early years of the 20th centuries, Japanese divers were recruited as pearl divers. They wore cumbersome full dive suits made of canvas with copper helmets and lead weighted boots which enabled them to  dive in very deep waters.
At the cemetery, obelisks mark the graves of over 900 Japanese pearlers. Most died due to decompression sickness or other illnesses related to diving.</groundspeak:long_description>

Pearl Lugger

In the early 1950's the first cultured pearl farm began in Kuri Bay, north of Broome. These days there are many pearl farms in the unpolluted waters near Broome. A number of manufacturers and retail outlets in town specialise in transforming these unique gems into beautiful jewellery items.
In the courtyard at this location, you will see an original pearl lugger and a display of old time diving gear.</groundspeak:long_description>

Sun Picture House

The Sun Pictures building in Broome's China town, was constructed in 1905 by the Yamasaki family. Initially the structure served as an Asian Emporium with a portion of the building devoted to a traditional Japanese Noh theatre.
In 1913, Master Pearler Ted Hunter purchased the building and converted it into a 500 seat outdoor picture theatre, opening with a silent movie in December 1916.
Over the years Sun Pictures has had a succession of owners and is significant as the world's oldest outdoor picture garden.</groundspeak:long_description>
