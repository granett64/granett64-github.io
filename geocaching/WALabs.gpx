It is part of the 1.2 hectares (3 acres) of land donated by Wallace Bickley for a school for the children of the Canning in 1863.

In 1865 a rammed earth building with shingle roof was constructed by convicts. The school, with accommodation for a school teacher and police constable, served as school, courthouse, church, post office and social centre for many years. 

A church, St Michael and All Angels, was built on a site next to the school and served the district until the end of the century.

The school closed in 1896 and in 1900 the school and church were demolished. Only the cemetery remains. Over 200 people were buried at the cemetery during its use, however few grave stones remain.

This Lab should take about 2 hours to complete and all sites should have good phone coverage. 

While you are visiting the various locations please take the opportunity to read a few of the headstones, finding about the area and the history of the people who are laid to rest there.  Sometimes it may give a hint as to what they did and where they originated from. 

Very importantly, please remember where you are and show the appropriate respect for the residents and people visiting them.

There is also an optional bonus mystery cache to find once you have finished.  You will need to collect the clues provided in the journals to solve the puzzle and get the cache coordinates.  

Good luck and have fun!

Three free standing figure sculptures made of burnished aluminium with brightly coloured artwork ceramic tiles representing travel, time and the seasons and special tiles by community members. These works are designed to be bold and colourful and to make reference to ancient shapes and symbols. The symbols used in the designs are associated with Nyoongar ideas about travel,  camps and resting points on a journey, sources of water and food, traditional walk paths and the passing of time as represented by the six seasons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/791572a5-4bd6-47e9-924f-496371c4f927" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public Transport Authority Public Art

While the PTA is predominately about moving people from one place to another, they have commissioned some spectacular pieces of art which can be contemplated while you wait for your train to arrive.

This Adventure Lab takes you to some examples along the Armadale line. The geofences are fairly generous and you might be able do some stages while on the train. However a closer inspection of these works is highly recommended.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

New offices were built in Maddington and local administration for the area did not move to Gosnells until 1973 when the present offices were opened near the corner of Gosnells Road and the Albany Highway.

Maddington Farm was established by John Randell Phillips. In 1833 he sold it to Major William Nairn, who renamed it Maddington Park and built a large two-storey house that was a fine example of colonial architecture. The Harris family owned the property from the 1870s until 1983. Vegetables were always grown at Maddington Park but when electricity was connected in 1927,  production increased as pump fed irrigation could be introduced. Cauliflowers and cabbages were the main winter crops, watermelons and rockmelons in summer. Potatoes were also grown.  From the  1950s  to  1970  the property was producing an average of 180,000 cauliflowers per year. Suburban sprawl began to encroach on the market garden and much of the property was sold in 1978 for the Maddington shopping complex. In 2004 the house was devastated by fire.

Paperbarks (Melaleuca sp) and Flooded Gums (Eucalyptus rudis) are the most prolific trees in the area. Aboriginal people traditionally used the paperbark leaves for medicinal purposes, including chewing the young leaves to alleviate headaches and other ailments. It was used for cradles, as bandages, sleeping mats, as a building material, for wrapping food and as a disposable raincoat.
Just slightly to the south of Burslem Bridge the Southern River joins the Canning River.
Nyungar people call the Canning River "Djarlgarra". The river provided plentiful food to the Beeliar and Beloo people – fish, eggs, snakes, lizards, tortoises, marron, gilgies and birds were found here.

Davis and his wife Frances and seven children set sail from London and arrived in the Swan River Colony in 1829. 
They had been attracted to advertisements in England for cheap land and were allocated a staggering 7026 acres that covered almost all of what we know today as Gosnells including Huntingdale and Southern River. 

The Davis family named their farm Chenies and planted wheat and vegetables. Life was hard and isolated in their new home. Frances died in 1835 only six years after arriving and John died a year later after a long illness.  Both were buried here on their property. 
The headstone on their grave is a replica of the original which has been stored for preservation. In 1983 their great-grandchildren planted a tree at their gravesite.

John, a tailor from Ballarat, relocated with his wife Emma in 1905.  Their  27  acre  property  produced  large  amounts  of  citrus  fruit,  stone  fruit  and  almonds. Like  all  early  properties  fronting  the  Canning  River,  was  irrigated  from  the  river.  Their property is typical of the period with a high pitched roof and sweeping verandah.  Today  the  Wilkinson's  property  offers  a  chance  to  step  back  in  time  and  discover  the history  of  the  area.  The  museum  features  a  collection  of  textiles,  agricultural  machinery, household  items,  furniture,  photographs  and  a  1927 Essex  motor  vehicle.  The  shed  is made  from  material  salvaged  from  the  Maddington  Centenary  Hall,  the  1929  Gosnells Road  Board  building  and  the  Orange  Grove  brickworks.

Bird was an architect and a partner of the Mason Bird Timber Company with access to excellent timbers; some of which can be seen in the door surrounds within the house.  The house has an interesting history having been through many owners until acquired by the Town of Canning for restoration and opened as a local museum in 1978.  At the rear of Woodloes is a reproduction of the Congregational Church with the Chimney which stood on Albany Highway until 1988 when it was demolished due to the widening of the highway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/ed637c44-87e6-4cba-8944-4e209837ba79" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Welcome to our Adventure Lab which will take you on a journey to some places of interest around the Canning River.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

By 1869 a steam-powered sawmill was established by the riverside to process the timber before it was stacked onto barges and taken down the river to Perth and Fremantle. Francis Bird joined him as a partner in 1871. A wooden railway (later capped with iron) joined the mill in the hills with the landing. Timber wagons were hauled by horses and the route was approximately along that now occupied by Bickley Road. Masonmill Road is in Carmel and sawpits were still in the area when a rose nursery was established on the hills mill site after WWII.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/ed637c44-87e6-4cba-8944-4e209837ba79" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Welcome to our Adventure Lab which will take you on a journey to some places of interest around the Canning River.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Although it was a roughly drawn mud map, it clearly showed five locations within the valley where details could be found that would lead to a well-hidden secret cache.

This vantage point provides splendid panoramic views across the valley and down to the the winding river at the bottom. As you take in the view, you can't help but notice a number of tall wooden or metal uprights, some with banners fluttering in the breeze.

This solitary monument stands defiantly as a tribute to those local heroes who made the ultimate sacrifice in years gone by.

We had been rummaging around in the garage and found it under a drawer lining in an old desk.  Although it was a roughly drawn mud map, it clearly showed five locations within the valley where details could be found that would lead to a well-hidden secret cache.

Landscape scenes of trees and houses sculptured from galvanised steel have been incorporated into the station fences. Outside the station two bench seats have been adorned with the same theme, you'll need to inspect the one on the Lissiman st side.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/791572a5-4bd6-47e9-924f-496371c4f927" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public Transport Authority Public Art

While the PTA is predominately about moving people from one place to another, they have commissioned some spectacular pieces of art which can be contemplated while you wait for your train to arrive.

This Adventure Lab takes you to some examples along the Armadale line. The geofences are fairly generous and you might be able do some stages while on the train. However a closer inspection of these works is highly recommended.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Michael and Fermina Pages left Spain in 1904 with their six children and arrived in Western Australia. Michael worked on farms in Darlington before selecting a block in Martin which they developed into a successful farm. Andres Pages established a store and in the 1920s with the rapid uptake of motor vehicles, installed a petrol bowser out the front of the store which developed into a garage. The Pages garage was very successful and other family members worked as carriers until the 1950s. This site of the park was a former residence which was cleared in the late 1960s. The mature trees on the site were evident within the former garden. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/979c4783-24fa-4cc7-abaa-9609b17fa833" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This little tour will take you around the heart of Gosnells to some obvious and some less obvious examples of suburban street art, celebrating culture, heritage and diversity in the City.

Lorenna took her inspiration, in part, from the constructed wetlands surrounding the administration building as something of a 'return' to what was at the site in the past, a naturally occurring wetland. 
The spiral is an ancient symbol that speaks of the life, death and rebirth cycle. This symbol is found on every inhabited continent and is used in Aboriginal art as a symbol of flowing water and the Ouroboros or snake eating its own tail (representing the same events occurring over and over- cyclically)
The poetry embedded in the base of the work speaks of a return to the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/9e752fde-7f3a-4e23-9641-68ba854fbcf1" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This Adventure Lab will take you for a pleasant stroll in and around around the Canning City Civic area  which showcases a variety of interesting and unique cultural and natural features within a well planned and beautifully presented garden and wetland setting.

The original War Memorial was situated in front of the Town Hall building on Albany Highway but vandalism caused it to be moved to Memorial Park at the corner of Albany Highway and Manning Road.  As this existing memorial is squeezed onto a small parcel of land between two very busy roads and with the number of attendees at Anzac Day increasing, major events now take place in this safer and more expansive location. 
The memorial fountain, made from sandblasted granite, is the work of Susanna Castleden. The Memorial itself consists of four elements: The Memorial Path, the Sites of Conflict, Ataturk's Tribute and the Wish for Peace. Further details of these elements can be found on the plaque to the right of the fountain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/9e752fde-7f3a-4e23-9641-68ba854fbcf1" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This Adventure Lab will take you for a pleasant stroll in and around around the Canning City Civic area  which showcases a variety of interesting and unique cultural and natural features within a well planned and beautifully presented garden and wetland setting.

You are standing in front of the city's focal sculpture.  This interesting piece of art was created by Jahne Rees  whose brief was to reflect aspects of the the general culture and heritage of the City of Canning and the specific site location.  Jahne chose to explore the themes that connected the historical use of the site (as a garden nursery) and the current and ongoing role of the City in the life of the community. The work is intended to evoke a range of interpretations including the fertile earth nurturing the seed and a sense of opening and striving upward in a relationship of mutual support and growth.  
The City has had to make some "adjustments" to the base of the work to deter local skateboarders whose 'community use' of the sculpture was causing considerable damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/9e752fde-7f3a-4e23-9641-68ba854fbcf1" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This Adventure Lab will take you for a pleasant stroll in and around around the Canning City Civic area  which showcases a variety of interesting and unique cultural and natural features within a well planned and beautifully presented garden and wetland setting.

The railing in front of the building is the work of Peter Zappa whose brief was to develop a railing to replace the existing functional but plain steel post railing that was installed in the 1980's. This artwork celebrates continuous movement and change but also the steadfast qualities of local government. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/9e752fde-7f3a-4e23-9641-68ba854fbcf1" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This Adventure Lab will take you for a pleasant stroll in and around around the Canning City Civic area  which showcases a variety of interesting and unique cultural and natural features within a well planned and beautifully presented garden and wetland setting.

A stylised tree of colourful crows decorated with designs translated from artwork created by Saint Joseph Primary School students. The artwork also doubles as a bench with an engaging perforated pattern of crows in flight which cast differing shadows depending on the time of day. The inspiration comes from the historic phrase used by travellers and people giving directions to describe the shortest route between two points travelling in a direct line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/791572a5-4bd6-47e9-924f-496371c4f927" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public Transport Authority Public Art

While the PTA is predominately about moving people from one place to another, they have commissioned some spectacular pieces of art which can be contemplated while you wait for your train to arrive.

This Adventure Lab takes you to some examples along the Armadale line. The geofences are fairly generous and you might be able do some stages while on the train. However a closer inspection of these works is highly recommended.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Clever businessman Benjamin Mason saw an opportunity. First, he harvested timber along the Canning River and established a steam-driven mill at Mason’s landing in Cannington. Soon the Cannington area was cleared and Mason obtained a licence to harvest timber near Bickley Brook, 15km from the mill. In 1864 Mason built a second timber mill in what is today the suburb of Carmel (Mason’s Mill). In 1870 architect Francis Bird joined the operation and led the construction of a timber tramway to transport timber from Mason’s Mill to Mason’s landing on horse-drawn trolleys. From where you stand, the tramway followed down Hardinge Rd, then Bickley Rd all the way to Cannington.
Walking uphill towards the location of where the mill used to be, this walk will take you on a little historic adventure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/438b35a2-abe2-41b5-b41e-a4336c444901" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This lab cache invites you to follow the “Mason and Bird Heritage Trail”, following the first 4 km of what used to be the original timber tramway, built in 1870 by the Mason and Bird Timber company to transport timber downhill to Mason's landing in Cannington. 
The one-way trail has a length of about 4.5 km, 9 km return, this will take you about 2 hours one way (4 hour return). We recommend parking at the Hardinge Park (observe gate opening times). 
Wear appropriate shoe wear and carry sufficient water!
Locations 1 to 3 follow a well-prepared path. Between location 3 and 4 you will have to climb a hill and the path is covered in loose rocks. If you prefer not to walk that section, you have the option to park at the end of the trail and complete location 4 and 5 from the other side. 
Mobile reception can be a little patchy throughout the trail, so we have increased the geofence to make sure you receive all data you need. 
Where appropriate, we state exact coordinates to find the required information.

If you are interested, further down the hill (S32 01.922 E 116 02.934) you will find remains of a foundation.
The foundations here are thought to have supported a brick building that was used by the Boy's Brigade which was active here in the 1960's.

(1850 - 1868) and the remnants of the fence are clearly visible.  It was built to keep a channel open for timber barges from the Mason Bird Company to travel up and down the river.  It is known that convicts, standing waist deep in the water used shovels to keep the channel free of mud, throwing the mud over the fence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/ed637c44-87e6-4cba-8944-4e209837ba79" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Welcome to our Adventure Lab which will take you on a journey to some places of interest around the Canning River.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

There are so many surprises hidden all over  the campus - the fun is in discovering all the hidden spaces, interactive pieces, historical artefacts and urban art... 

The best place to start then is Platform 9 and 3/4 and see what wizardry awaits you!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/3f1633b2-956e-4800-b926-07d872ff1164" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's more than meets the eye at Curtin University's Bentley campus. 

Curtin is the largest of Western Australia's universities. It's main campus at Bentley, situated on a former pine plantation, stretches over 116 hectares. 
  
Around campus you will find award winning architecture, hidden gardens, urban art and secret tidbitz at every turn - this adventure will take you to just a few favourites - be sure to explore a little more and see what treasures you uncover!

PLEASE NOTE WELL:
Parking is paid. There are 5 different colour coded zones. Rates and access vary. Please take note and park accordingly. Inspectors are are often swift and fines can be hefty. 

Consider arriving via an alternative method. Getting to Curtin is fairly easy, with good transperth bus connections and free local shuttles (from Waterford, Bentley, Vic Park and South Perth).&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

CAS (building 211) is an Indigenous-managed research and education centre that contributes to positive social change for Aboriginal Australians.

Unlike most other buildings at Curtin, the centre is circular in design to represent unity and equality.
Inside is the Midgegoroo Meeting Place, used to hold exhibitions, functions and special ceremonies.

At this waypoint (between Building 211 and 209) is a representation of the 6 Noongar seasons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/3f1633b2-956e-4800-b926-07d872ff1164" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's more than meets the eye at Curtin University's Bentley campus.

There are 5 lab locations, one at each station where the CircleRoute crosses a train line. A bonus final cache is located in Fremantle, the start and end point of the CircleRoute.

Make sure you also pick up the 17 traditional caches located at each timing point along the CircleRoute. &lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

You can start at either car park on the top or bottom, depending on how you want to walk it. There is a defined path which will take you up or down the side of the falls, giving you stunning views the entire way. At the top are multiple trails which take you to vantage points of Perth below and you can even walk to Lions Lookout nearby! As with all of these waterfalls, it is even more spectacular after heavy rainfall.

Distance: Numerous trails starting at 1km

Perth has a good collection of waterfalls within its hills, snuggled up against the scarp, some higher than others but all set in beautiful natural bushlands.
Pack a picnic, your hiking boots, walking poles and don't forget your camera. 

*Please note: all but one of these locations will require a short hike, sometimes over rough ground.*

Built by convicts in 1871/72 it formed part of the Mason and Bird Timber Tramway. The Jarrah decking has been replaced but the piles below are thought to be original Wandoo which supported the Jarrah rails and sleepers over the Munday Brook. Remains of the convict-built embankment and roadway leading to the bridge are still visible.

Find the larger plaque at the Western end of the bridge (big boulder).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/438b35a2-abe2-41b5-b41e-a4336c444901" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This lab cache invites you to follow the “Mason and Bird Heritage Trail”, following the first 4 km of what used to be the original timber tramway, built in 1870 by the Mason and Bird Timber company to transport timber downhill to Mason's landing in Cannington. 
The one-way trail has a length of about 4.5 km, 9 km return, this will take you about 2 hours one way (4 hour return). We recommend parking at the Hardinge Park (observe gate opening times). 
Wear appropriate shoe wear and carry sufficient water!
Locations 1 to 3 follow a well-prepared path. Between location 3 and 4 you will have to climb a hill and the path is covered in loose rocks. If you prefer not to walk that section, you have the option to park at the end of the trail and complete location 4 and 5 from the other side. 
Mobile reception can be a little patchy throughout the trail, so we have increased the geofence to make sure you receive all data you need. 
Where appropriate, we state exact coordinates to find the required information.

The first buildings for WAIT took a utilitarian ‘brutalist’ style of brick and off-form concrete that reflected the practical and egalitarian nature of the institution. These buildings are now a celebrated example of modernist architecture of this era.

In 1987 the institute became Curtn University of Technology, Australia's first university of technology. The "of Technology" suffix was eventually dropped in 2010, from then on operating as "Curtin University".

At this location - Building 201 - you can see some of the original features and brutalist architecture of WAIT.
Designed with a street market in mind, inside you will find a central atrium, open air staircases and Juliette balconies.

Currently operating as 'Library 201' this building is open weekdays 8am  to 10pm and weekends 10am to 6pm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/3f1633b2-956e-4800-b926-07d872ff1164" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's more than meets the eye at Curtin University's Bentley campus. 

Curtin is the largest of Western Australia's universities. It's main campus at Bentley, situated on a former pine plantation, stretches over 116 hectares. 
  
Around campus you will find award winning architecture, hidden gardens, urban art and secret tidbitz at every turn - this adventure will take you to just a few favourites - be sure to explore a little more and see what treasures you uncover!

PLEASE NOTE WELL:
Parking is paid. There are 5 different colour coded zones. Rates and access vary. Please take note and park accordingly. Inspectors are are often swift and fines can be hefty. 

Consider arriving via an alternative method. Getting to Curtin is fairly easy, with good transperth bus connections and free local shuttles (from Waterford, Bentley, Vic Park and South Perth).&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

The Japanese Garden in the courtyard of Building 401 is a quiet place where you will find water features, even koi!

Lesmurdie Falls is the spectacular point where Lesmurdie Brook plummets 40 metres over the granite edge of the Darling Scarp into the lush valley below. 
Located within the Mundy Regional Park, the area around the falls offers stunning views over the Swan Coastal Plain as well as access to lookouts and relatively short and easy hiking trails ranging from the short 300m Cascades Walk to the 3km Valley Loop Trail.
This adlab extends from the Cascades down to the Lesmurdie Falls lookouts, a distance of less than 1km.
At the starting point, there is a large carpark, picnic tables and toilet facilities. Please note there is no potable drinking water available, dogs are permitted on a leash and there is an optional mystery bonus cache available.

The Gallery is one of WA’s major public art galleries, and is also one of the largest and best equipped university galleries in the country.

The Library was Australia's first Prime Ministerial Library. It houses personal records, photos and objects and more related to John Curtin and is available for research use. The library also hosts notable academic and political figures for events.

The dual-use pathway provides a safe walk-friendly environment for people of all ages as well as an opportunity to be awed by the abundance of birdlife on and around the lake.

Enjoy a short walk around (half) the lake and marvel at the breeding colony of Australian White ibises as you cross the boardwalk bridge. 

There is a mystery bonus cache for those interested in such things.

Lesmurdie Falls is the spectacular point where Lesmurdie Brook plummets 40 metres over the granite edge of the Darling Scarp into the lush valley below. 
Located within the Mundy Regional Park, the area around the falls offers stunning views over the Swan Coastal Plain as well as access to lookouts and relatively short and easy hiking trails ranging from the short 300m Cascades Walk to the 3km Valley Loop Trail.
This adlab extends from the Cascades down to the Lesmurdie Falls lookouts, a distance of less than 1km.
At the starting point, there is a large carpark, picnic tables and toilet facilities. Please note there is no potable drinking water available, dogs are permitted on a leash and there is an optional mystery bonus cache available.

Lesmurdie Falls is the spectacular point where Lesmurdie Brook plummets 40 metres over the granite edge of the Darling Scarp into the lush valley below. 
Located within the Mundy Regional Park, the area around the falls offers stunning views over the Swan Coastal Plain as well as access to lookouts and relatively short and easy hiking trails ranging from the short 300m Cascades Walk to the 3km Valley Loop Trail.
This adlab extends from the Cascades down to the Lesmurdie Falls lookouts, a distance of less than 1km.
At the starting point, there is a large carpark, picnic tables and toilet facilities. Please note there is no potable drinking water available, dogs are permitted on a leash and there is an optional mystery bonus cache available.

Established in 1988 under the Singapore Airlines Group, it is the training school for cadet pilots with Singapore Airlines, Scoot and Singapore Airlines Cargo.
The SFC headquarters is located at SIA Training Centre, Singapore, in close proximity to Changi Airport and is where the ATPL ground training phase is conducted.

On successful completion of Ground Training Phase, cadets subsequently move to SFC's other training facility at Jandakot Airport in Perth, Western Australia to continue with their Flight Training for the Multi-crew Pilot License.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/a095ea7a-8514-43c0-84f7-f59bbf954654" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Opened in 1963, Jandakot Airport is the major General Aviation airport in Western Australia, and is one of the busiest airfields and largest aviation training bases in Australia.
It accommodates the aircraft of service organisations, including the Royal Flying Doctor Service, CALM Forest and Bushfire Patrol, and the WA Police Air Support. Jandakot airport is also a major training base for international airline pilots.

It should take 30 - 45 minutes to complete this Lab and there is a bonus box to pick up at the end - GC9FYFF.

The main campus building includes a 1,500 square metre hangar facility that houses a variety of aircraft including SM TAFE's very own Boeing 737. Our Boeing 737 is maintained in a fully serviceable condition and used as a non-flying static training facility for students across an array of training courses, from pilot studies, to cabin crew, to aircraft maintenance, and even safety and ground handling.
Other facilities and training devices available for students include additional fixed wing and rotorcraft static trainers, a learning resource centre with computer and wireless internet resources, computer-based training modules and a flight simulator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/a095ea7a-8514-43c0-84f7-f59bbf954654" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Opened in 1963, Jandakot Airport is the major General Aviation airport in Western Australia, and is one of the busiest airfields and largest aviation training bases in Australia.

Material taken from this pit (and others in the area) has been used for the Orange Grove Brickwork. Pockets of this specific type of clay can be found throughout the area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/438b35a2-abe2-41b5-b41e-a4336c444901" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This lab cache invites you to follow the “Mason and Bird Heritage Trail”, following the first 4 km of what used to be the original timber tramway, built in 1870 by the Mason and Bird Timber company to transport timber downhill to Mason's landing in Cannington. 
The one-way trail has a length of about 4.5 km, 9 km return, this will take you about 2 hours one way (4 hour return). We recommend parking at the Hardinge Park (observe gate opening times). 
Wear appropriate shoe wear and carry sufficient water!
Locations 1 to 3 follow a well-prepared path. Between location 3 and 4 you will have to climb a hill and the path is covered in loose rocks. If you prefer not to walk that section, you have the option to park at the end of the trail and complete location 4 and 5 from the other side. 
Mobile reception can be a little patchy throughout the trail, so we have increased the geofence to make sure you receive all data you need. 
Where appropriate, we state exact coordinates to find the required information.

You will be treated with smaller waterfalls along the route and can return along the other side allowing for a change of scenery and a beautiful overgrown wonderland at the very end. Interestingly, will see the remains of a once existing Japanese styled cottage.

Distance: 3.5km return walk
Recommended for: Beginners&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/38a3bbf1-4aa8-494d-97b9-f8694299312b" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’ve found yourself a clear day after a heavy downpour, the best thing you can do is hop in your car and get yourself to one of these waterfall hikes as soon as possible! Perth has a good collection of waterfalls within its hills, snuggled up against the scarp, some higher than others but all set in beautiful natural bushlands.
Pack a picnic, your hiking boots, walking poles and don't forget your camera. 

*Please note: all but one of these locations will require a short hike, sometimes over rough ground.*

Her mother was the writer Dame Mary Durack and her father was an aviator, Captain Horrie Miller.
After obtaining a private pilot licence and a commercial flying licence while training as a nurse, she approached the Western Australian Department of Health to ask permission to fly to northern Western Australia in order to carry out a vaccination programme.
Permission granted, she borrowed money for a Cessna 182 Skylane and set out on her first flight on 22 May 1967. Travelling to remote communities, she would treat children with the Sabin vaccine in sugar lumps. She later flew with the Royal Flying Doctor Service of Australia (RFDS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/a095ea7a-8514-43c0-84f7-f59bbf954654" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Opened in 1963, Jandakot Airport is the major General Aviation airport in Western Australia, and is one of the busiest airfields and largest aviation training bases in Australia.

This huge grassed area with several picnic tables make the perfect place to enjoy some morning or afternoon tea, or some lunch - while watching planes take off and land one after the other.
Disabled parking is available.

The area has been named "Robert J Cross Park" in honour of the first Jandakot Airport employee. Robert "Bob" Cross commenced working at Jandakot Airport when the airport opened in 1963, and he was responsible for maintaining the entire airport site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/a095ea7a-8514-43c0-84f7-f59bbf954654" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Opened in 1963, Jandakot Airport is the major General Aviation airport in Western Australia, and is one of the busiest airfields and largest aviation training bases in Australia.
It accommodates the aircraft of service organisations, including the Royal Flying Doctor Service, CALM Forest and Bushfire Patrol, and the WA Police Air Support. Jandakot airport is also a major training base for international airline pilots.

It should take 30 - 45 minutes to complete this Lab and there is a bonus box to pick up at the end - GC9FYFF.

As with all international arrivals into Western Australia, Perth Airport is where the final day of competition began.
Teams arrived in Perth from Singapore, where they had already completed a number of tasks. Make your way to the airport viewing platform to start your Perth-fect Race Adventure.


Please be aware of the opening times for this location:
October-March 06:30-19:00
April-September 07:30-17:30

It sees teams race against each other around the world, completing challenges along the way to get the next piece of information needed to continue on the race.

The first season of The Amazing Race Australia was in 2011. It saw 11 teams race around the world going to 10 countries and covering over 50 000km. The series culminated in the final three teams racing around Perth completing challenges attempting to arrive at the check-in point first and claim a $250 000 prize.

In this recreation of the final leg you will have to make your way along the same route that the teams did to claim your final prize, not cash but a cache (GC9G7E2).&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Despite being owned and operated by an ex-service organisation, the museum’s focus is not restricted to military aviation and the collection features a lot of exhibits related to civil aviation in Western Australia. Most of these items which include uniforms, insignia, aircraft are housed in the South Wing, which also includes their First World War collection. The North Wing is home to the larger aircraft in the collection and has a greater emphasis on the Royal Australian Air Force and its operations during peace and war. 

In addition to the two display hangars the museum also has a separate library, photo archive, model aeroplane club-room and of course, a gift shop.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/58814ab7-66e9-4885-b1d4-1399d838349f" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Western Australia has some significant military locations, which have played an important role in the country’s wartime history. There are many military museums from Albany in the South, Broome in the North, and Kalgoorlie in the East. 

This series looks at some of the local military sites in the Perth area, which includes World War II Tunnels, local Telecommunications, Spitfires, Tanks and Artillery. 

Most museums have restricted opening hours, however the WWII Tunnels and tours of HMAS Ovens are temporarily suspended due to Covid-19. 

Important: 
The WWII Tunnels location in Mosman Park will take some physical effort to reach the site, however there is a path for wheelchairs and people with walking aides. Please follow the Directional Signs from the Boundary Road Carpark to the Heritage Site - approximately 350 metres.

This work consists of two major objects, a large self-patinating steel speaker-bell and a smaller, similarly-shaped speaker in stainless steel. The two objects are linked by an interactive audio program developed by visually-impaired sound artist Rob Muir, referencing the important link the station has with patrons of the nearby Association for the Blind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/791572a5-4bd6-47e9-924f-496371c4f927" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public Transport Authority Public Art

While the PTA is predominately about moving people from one place to another, they have commissioned some spectacular pieces of art which can be contemplated while you wait for your train to arrive.

This Adventure Lab takes you to some examples along the Armadale line. The geofences are fairly generous and you might be able do some stages while on the train. However a closer inspection of these works is highly recommended.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

It is now a privately owned orchard.
At the hight of the Mason and Bird Timber Company, 138 men worked here, utilising 40 horses and 80 bullocks, producing up to 20,000 feet of timber a day. 
Up to 400 people lived in the community which formed around the mill and included shops, a school and a sports ground.

The one-way trail has a length of about 4.5 km, 9 km return, this will take you about 2 hours one way (4 hour return). We recommend parking at the Hardinge Park (observe gate opening times). 
Wear appropriate shoe wear and carry sufficient water!
Locations 1 to 3 follow a well-prepared path. Between location 3 and 4 you will have to climb a hill and the path is covered in loose rocks. If you prefer not to walk that section, you have the option to park at the end of the trail and complete location 4 and 5 from the other side. 
Mobile reception can be a little patchy throughout the trail, so we have increased the geofence to make sure you receive all data you need. 
Where appropriate, we state exact coordinates to find the required information.

At its maximum extent in the 1930s the network consisted of over 50 km of track and operated along 35 different routes.

Lines were built all over the inner suburbs of Perth, including to:
o	Victoria Park (via the Causeway and Albany Hwy)
o	South Perth Zoo (via the Causeway and Angelo St)

This site celebrates the nearby tram stop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/6104c3a2-b08e-4acc-82d8-d3a248650aec" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This Adventure Lab will take you by foot or bike (or other non-motorised transport) along what is surely one of the nicest paths in Perth – the southern shores of “Perth Water”.

The tour is best done by walking or cycling, although it is possible to drive from site to site even though that would be defeating the purpose. You can start at either end, or wherever you choose. This Adventure Lab does not require you to visit the sites in any ordered sequence.

The pathways along the foreshore provide outstanding views across Perth Water to the city. Along the way you’ll be able to learn a bit about various activities and land uses that occurred on and near the South Perth foreshore over the years.

Please note that some of the paths are for cyclists only, and some are for pedestrians only. The length of the tour is about 4.7km (if walking) from the Causeway bridge to the Narrows (one way) and a little bit more if cycling. There are plenty of opportunities for rest and refreshments along the way.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

The Cygnet Cinema opened in 1938 and was built by local identity and film entrepreneur James Stiles. It is an excellent example of the art deco style of architect William Leighton and is included on the State's Heritage Register.

They owned a considerable amount of property along Mounts Bay Road and established a dairy on the Perth side of Jacob’s Ladder.

John Manning (Junior) moved some of the Mounts Bay herd to South Perth and began a dairy business around 1877. He purchased 100 acres of property known as Location 38b on the South Perth foreshore for ten shillings an acre which came to be known as Southbourne. The Southbourne house was located on the corner of Hurlingham Street and Manning Terrace, and John cleared and cultivated the riverfront ground between Southbourne and Ellam Street, being ideal land for growing crops, pasture and vegetables.

The Manning and neighbouring Douglas dairy helped to supply Perth with fresh milk.

This section is the longest section between towns - Kalamunda and Dwellingup being the only towns. Mundaring Weir and North Bannister do not have re-supply facilities for walkers. Through walkers will need to plan ahead and organise food drops.

In 1827 the Colonial Botanist Mr Charles Fraser and Captain James Stirling explored the region to evaluate its suitability for farming. Initially the area was used for forestry and orchards; fruit growing continues to be one of the major industries in the City today. The Townsite of Kalamunda was approved in 1902 and quickly established itself as a tourism destination. Advertised as a ‘health resort’, City folk would travel to Kalamunda to experience nature, fresh air and a change of climate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/a4bbaae6-16b8-4dd7-a15a-aff6097da10b" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bibbulmun Track is one of the world’s great long distance walk trails, stretching 1000km from Kalamunda in the Perth Hills, to Albany on the south coast, winding through the heart of the scenic South West of Western Australia.

The Track is for walkers only and is signposted with yellow triangular markers symbolising the Waugal, the rainbow serpent of the Aboriginal Dreaming. Trail markers are spaced up to 500m apart.

Nyoongar people are known and acknowledged as the traditional owners and custodians of the land and waters over which the Bibbulmun Track passes. Nyoongar people have a deep spiritual, emotional, social and physical connection to “country” (Boodja). Nyoongar people ask you to please respect the Boodja when you walk the Bibbulmun Track to ensure its natural and cultural values are preserved for all future generations.

This Lab will take you on five towns that it runs by and is used as a break/restock of supplies by those walking the track.

The Island is in the area known to the local Noongar people as Matagarup and was a significant river crossing with no other crossings possible downstream until Fremantle.
Originally a number of islands were surrounded by mud flats. Reclaimation and dredging around the area over the years produced the 0.3km2 island you see today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/59ba51eb-26ca-4ea3-b29a-9d8f9fb679a9" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Amazing Race is a reality television program that started in the US in 2001.

It sees teams race against each other around the world, completing challenges along the way to get the next piece of information needed to continue on the race.

The first season of The Amazing Race Australia was in 2011. It saw 11 teams race around the world going to 10 countries and covering over 50 000km. The series culminated in the final three teams racing around Perth completing challenges attempting to arrive at the check-in point first and claim a $250 000 prize.

In this recreation of the final leg you will have to make your way along the same route that the teams did to claim your final prize, not cash but a cache (GC9G7E2).&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

You should be able to find all five points within about 15 minutes, unless of course you decide to stop to admire the beauty. Minnawarra Park is also used for various community events throughout the year.

The main feature of the park is the ornamental lake which has several fountains running to aerate the water and stop algae from forming. The lake also supports a large number of ducks and other birds all year round. It is fed from Sanctuary Lake on the other side of Armadale Road, which in turn is fed by  Neerigen Brook. Sanctuary Lake is a safe haven from predators for birds and allows for limited nest sites during breeding season. 

After answering the question for each waypoint correctly, you'll be able to work out the coordinates of the Bonus cache - GC983CR . The Bonus cache can be found at S 32 08.uvw  E 116 00.xyz&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Tales of an affair leading to suicide, mysterious old men on the balcony, a Victorian dressed woman and a mystery man all surround the building and its past. 

Images of the supernatural have been captured and management will always tell you, you are never lonely at the Kalamunda.

Perth is no different. 

Tales of ghostly encounters can be found across the city and by partaking on this paranormal hunt you may experience your very own unexplained event.

Your adventure covers approximately 53kms and is available anytime however to fully experience possibilities of the afterlife, it is suggested you wait until darkness falls. A good torch will be needed if venturing out after dark.

You should be able to find all five points within about 15 minutes, unless of course you decide to stop to admire the beauty. Minnawarra Park is also used for various community events throughout the year.

The main feature of the park is the ornamental lake which has several fountains running to aerate the water and stop algae from forming. The lake also supports a large number of ducks and other birds all year round. It is fed from Sanctuary Lake on the other side of Armadale Road, which in turn is fed by  Neerigen Brook. Sanctuary Lake is a safe haven from predators for birds and allows for limited nest sites during breeding season.

Where the island currently stands was a much smaller island known as Kakaroomup. This area was a main crossing point from one side of the river to the other, where Noongars could wade through the water.  

The area in which Heirisson Island is currently located is an important area for Noongar people. A statue of Wadjuk Noongar warrior Yagan was erected on the island to recognise Yagan’s strong leadership and resistance fighting during the early years of the Swan River Colony. Amidst the fighting a bounty was set upon his head, he was shot, his head was removed and sent to London where it was exhibited as an "anthropological curiosity". A museum in Liverpool kept it more than a century before burying it with other remains in an unmarked grave in 1964. Noongars asked for repatriation, 177 years later, his head was finally buried in a traditional ceremony in the Swan Valley.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/79cbb012-2a74-4686-afba-7d425fd49400" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The City of Perth is Wadjuk Boodjar (Country) covering the area between Gargatup, the place down by the hillside (in Kings Park), and Matagarup, the place of the leg holes (Heirisson Island), where Noongars would cross the river. This area, near the lowest and easiest crossing point on the Swan River (at Matagarup), was an important communication and trade centre between the coast and the islands. Whadjuck/Balardong custodian Tom Bennell referred to Perth as ”Beerit” meaning ”pathways” due to its importance for meetings, travel and trade.

This Adventure Lab Cache will take you on an approximate 12km journey around Wadjuk Boodjar  depending on the route you take, you may walk, ride, drive (parts) or use public transport to get around, we recommend you give yourself a good half of a day to complete the adventure.

The base is located in Bullsbrook, north of Perth. It is used for training by the RAAF and the Republic of Singapore Air Force. 

The base also serves as an anti-hijacking training aid for Special Air Service Regiment counter-terrorism squadron, also known as Tactical Assault Group (West). It is used to practise airliner entry and hostage rescue drills. The base is home to a mockup of a Boeing 747 used for this counter-terrorism training. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/dc289c8f-ab76-4013-9afa-872188ca6ddc" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perth Airport is not the world's largest transfer hub but it (in normal times) does handle approx 1.3 million passengers per month!

The island was first documented by Willem de Vlamingh in 1696, who called it 't Eylandt 't Rottenest ("Rats' Nest Island") after the famous marsupial population. 

At one stage, the 32 km (20 mi) Perth to Rottnest flight was the world's shortest scheduled air route. The Jimmy Woods Air Terminal on the island is named after the pioneer aviator who flew scheduled flights to the island from 1948 to 1961.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/dc289c8f-ab76-4013-9afa-872188ca6ddc" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perth Airport is not the world's largest transfer hub but it (in normal times) does handle approx 1.3 million passengers per month!

Land transportation was difficult as the only river crossing near Perth, a ford at the eastern end of the town, was often impassable for wagons and carts. The next crossing point was 20 miles (32 km) upstream at Guildford, a major detour.

The first causeway was opened in 1843 and was originally a toll road.  (Perhaps the only one ever to be in WA.)

The second causeway was opened in 1867 after severe flooding damaged the original causeway.

The third and current causeway was built between 1947 and 1952 consisting of 2 bridges meeting at Heirisson Island after the Heirisson Islands were turned into a single island. The bridges were the "first truly modern bridges" built in Perth after World War II, being the first bridges in Western Australia to use steel composite construction, and only the second (and third) in Australia.

Indigenous Australians have been occupying Western Australia for around 40,000 to 60,000 years.

The first recorded European contact was in 1616 when Dutch explorer Dirk Hartog landed on the west coast but the first permanent settlement was not made until 1826 when a settlement was established at Albany to formally take possession of the western third of the continent of Australia for the British Crown.  The Swan River Colony was established in 1829 starting the official history of European settlement of Western Australia.

This set of lab caches explores the early buildings and places of the Swan River Colony.

It is located 30.0km from Perth. The original station was opened May 2nd 1893, the current station was opened on November 6th 2004&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/b725a41a-cce1-431d-909c-cab48dd07c51" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please be aware the locations for this Adventure Lab are quite a distance from the map marker, make sure you check your nearest Lab point before commencing.

The metropolitan Perth rail network is comprised of five major lines connecting the four Metropolitan Development Corridors and Fremantle to the Perth CBD.

Over the coming years the network is set to expand even further to accomade travelers from Ellenbrook, Forrestfield and extending lines past Armadale to Byford and continuing north to Yanchep.

This Adventure Lab will take you on a tour of the various lines of the Perth Rail Network. You are more than welcome to catch the trains to the stops (it can be done in a single day) if you wish but this is not a requirement, in fact all information can be gained and answered without entering the stations themselves.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

The first ferry service to operate from Coode Street was managed by W. F. Tubbs however it was very irregular. This service was replaced in 1898 by local residents Rowland Pennington and Fred Bailey, who formed a public company, the River Ferry Company, in hopes to bring some regularity to the service. The company had two sailing boats in action, the Mary Queen and the Gladys, however the venture was a failure.

In 1904, Jack Olsen and Claes (Harry) Sutton developed a thriving ferry business on the Swan River, including regular ferries to Coode Street.The Sutton and Olsen families continued to run the service until 1935 when they sold the business to the Swan River Ferries Company.

The private ferry service was eventually merged into the State Transport system and the jetty was rebuilt in 1990.

The tour is best done by walking or cycling, although it is possible to drive from site to site even though that would be defeating the purpose. You can start at either end, or wherever you choose. This Adventure Lab does not require you to visit the sites in any ordered sequence.

The pathways along the foreshore provide outstanding views across Perth Water to the city. Along the way you’ll be able to learn a bit about various activities and land uses that occurred on and near the South Perth foreshore over the years.

Please note that some of the paths are for cyclists only, and some are for pedestrians only. The length of the tour is about 4.7km (if walking) from the Causeway bridge to the Narrows (one way) and a little bit more if cycling. There are plenty of opportunities for rest and refreshments along the way.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Five tall, coloured sculptures stand outside the main entrance to the station in a piazza area with old wooden railway sleeper platforms. The works were designed to provide a sense of identity that reflect the nature of the site, its locality and history. This is not done in an overtly narrative way but incorporates symbols and images that refer to, rather than illustrate the ideas. The references are to forests and forestry, rail history and related artefacts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/791572a5-4bd6-47e9-924f-496371c4f927" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public Transport Authority Public Art

While the PTA is predominately about moving people from one place to another, they have commissioned some spectacular pieces of art which can be contemplated while you wait for your train to arrive.

This Adventure Lab takes you to some examples along the Armadale line. The geofences are fairly generous and you might be able do some stages while on the train. However a closer inspection of these works is highly recommended.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

The entire peninsula was granted to colonists arriving aboard the Tranby in 1830 and became known as the ‘Peninsula Farm’. Joseph Hardey was allocated a share of this land and he with his wife Ann built this house in 1839, after losing the previous two houses to flooding. Peninsula Farm remained in the Hardey family until 1913. Joseph Hardey and his son Richard, who took over management of the property in the late 1860s, were highly influential in the religious, business and political activities of the colony. Peninsula Farm was purchased by Harold Cheshire in 1951, to keep and train racehorses. The house and remnant land survived major subdivision as Perth became more urbanised and the National Trust took over management of the place in 1977.

The coords will take you to a plaque at the entrance to the house.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/939f9691-68c6-4270-9e7c-e4f5b846c975" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Maylands Peninsula is on the northern bank of the Swan River about 5 kilometres east of Perth's city centre, and has a rich and varied history. This Adventure Lab will take you to just a few of the interesting historical buildings and locations in the area. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

"Describe what you like about this location, including any specific instructions players may need to answer the Location Question."

What I like about this area is you can answer the final question then decide to either enjoy a cool beverage or a meal at the pub close by, let the kids have a play on one of the great playgrounds right here, go for a walk around the area and across the bridge to East Perth, bike the bridges or just chill out on the grass and enjoy the river.
This is an amazing place and it is right here in Perth. So answer the last silly question, enjoy the 5 smileys you earnt real quick and enjoy this area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/0835811f-a20f-4814-b617-83e6edb3eb82" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a quick little tour that will teach you not-a-lot about this and that.

Acknowledging the site’s significant heritage with this being a burial site for the local indigenous people, the Wadjuk Noongar, and with guidance from the Wadjuk Working Party, it offers a real celebration of Western Australia’s Aboriginal culture in many forms of art and landscape. 

The Arbour, a 350m long architectural tensioned cable-net structure, supporting indigenous inspired artwork panels, crawling vines and plants and feature programmable LED lighting is a walk way that weaves and slithers representing a Waugal - rainbow serpent, around a portion of Stadium Park.

This area, near the lowest and easiest crossing point on the Swan River (at Matagarup), was an important communication and trade centre between the coast and the islands. Whadjuck/Balardong custodian Tom Bennell referred to Perth as ”Beerit” meaning ”pathways” due to its importance for meetings, travel and trade.

This Adventure Lab Cache will take you on an approximate 12km journey around Wadjuk Boodjar  depending on the route you take, you may walk, ride, drive (parts) or use public transport to get around, we recommend you give yourself a good half of a day to complete the adventure.

The WACA ground was officially opened in 1983, it occupies a site of old swamp land. It is referred to as Western Australia's "home of cricket".

The pitch at the WACA is regarded as the quickest and bounciest in the world. Interestingly four of the nine fastest Test centuries have been scored at the WACA.
In 1932, Donald Bradman played at the ground for the first time and attracted a crowd in excess of 20,000

There is a fantastic museum at the WACA and tours of the grounds are conducted Monday to Friday 10am and 1pm – Duration 90 minutes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/2b086e18-1940-4fa8-ae54-650e6f68b64d" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This adventure takes you on a tour in the Perth CBD.

This tour takes advantage of the free to ride Red Cat Bus route, there are historic buildings, side tours, museums and parkland to checkout along the way.

If you are driving to the CBD, the adventure can be completed in any order, so just park up and hop on the bus anywhere along the route.
However I recommend catching the train into Perth CBD and commencing the adventure at the Red Cat Bus stop 24 - Wellington St Perth Station. From this stop the first location is St Mary's Cathedral.

Queens Gardens is a beautiful park, i have always noticed a strange calming effect when I have visited, it makes me feel like sitting down and forgetting about what I was doing and taking it all in. It seems to have the same effect on the other people I have noticed in the park. 

The history of the site is quite interesting, it is associated with the development of the City of Perth, but was originally used for recreation purposes including horse racing. Later on it was used as a clay mine and brickwork. Bricks that were produced here are part of some of Perth’s most prominent buildings, these include The Perth Town Hall, Barracks Arch and the Cloisters Building. The water lily filled lakes are the old clay pits.

The park features a replica of the Peter Pan statue located in Kensington Gardens in London. There were only six replicas of the statue made and relocated to various parts of the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/2b086e18-1940-4fa8-ae54-650e6f68b64d" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This adventure takes you on a tour in the Perth CBD.

Huggins, placed in the Church of England section of the Cemeteries.

William died in 1895 at the young age of only 34 years - recorded cause of death: heart failure. 

Look closely at the headstone inscription.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/957e74de-66e9-479e-81ab-7b42c23a772e" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The East Perth Cemeteries is a highly significant heritage place. From tuberculosis (brought to the colony from the Old World) to typhoid (a fever that struck Perth at the same time as gold fever), the graves of East Perth Cemeteries are a record of the first 70 years of European migration to what is now Perth. It is a remnant of what was seven independently owned and managed cemeteries covering seven religious/cultural groups, in addition to an eighth burial ground for felons.

As the area is fragile, entrance to the East Perth Cemeteries (now maintained by the National Trust of Western Australia) is only on Sundays between 2pm and 4pm. There is an entrance fee of $10 for adults. However, it is well worth a visit as it is one of a rare surviving group of colonial cemeteries that have retained a high degree of integrity and authenticity within the CBD of an Australian capital city.

The locations of this Adventure Lab are all outside the cemetery fence perimeter, accessible 24/7.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Thomas was born in England in 1819, and arrived in WA aboard the Eleanor in 1837. He married Margaret Nairn in 1847, and together they had 14 children. Thomas worked as a builder in Perth in the 1840s before moving to York in the 1950s where he farmed.  Thomas built a school on his property opposite Grigson's Well, presumably to educate his large family.

Thomas died in 1890, aged 71 years. His cause of death was not recorded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/957e74de-66e9-479e-81ab-7b42c23a772e" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The East Perth Cemeteries is a highly significant heritage place.

More than 90% of the grave headstones and markers were lost through decay, neglect or wanton destruction since then. Only 800 remain. The headstones tell stories of bravery, tragedy, illness and accident; of success and suffering.

In the middle of the Cemeteries stands a simple Gothic chapel designed by colonial architect, Richard Roach Jewell. Built in 1871 as a mortuary chapel, St Bartholomew’s became a parish church in 1888. After a period of neglect, it is still a consecrated church.

Originally located on the edge of the town, the Cemeteries today are a tranquil haven within bustling inner-city East Perth. They are open on Sundays between 2pm and 4pm.

Find the entrance sign to the right of the main entrance to the Cemetery and Church.  Counting the title lines find the 7th line on the sign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/7ba2105b-269b-4f75-9d77-8a158e9cdf1e" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Take a trip visiting the early European history of the Western Australia colony.

Indigenous Australians have been occupying Western Australia for around 40,000 to 60,000 years.

The first recorded European contact was in 1616 when Dutch explorer Dirk Hartog landed on the west coast but the first permanent settlement was not made until 1826 when a settlement was established at Albany to formally take possession of the western third of the continent of Australia for the British Crown.  The Swan River Colony was established in 1829 starting the official history of European settlement of Western Australia.

This set of lab caches explores the early buildings and places of the Swan River Colony.

St Bartholomew's is a simple Gothic church, designed by colonial architect Richard Roach Jewell and built in 1871. It is the only example of a mortuary chapel constructed in Western Australia. It became a parish church in 1888 and was almost doubled in size after extensions in 1900. Despite a period of neglect, St Bartholomew’s is still a consecrated church and is used for church services, weddings, and other religious events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/957e74de-66e9-479e-81ab-7b42c23a772e" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The East Perth Cemeteries is a highly significant heritage place. From tuberculosis (brought to the colony from the Old World) to typhoid (a fever that struck Perth at the same time as gold fever), the graves of East Perth Cemeteries are a record of the first 70 years of European migration to what is now Perth. It is a remnant of what was seven independently owned and managed cemeteries covering seven religious/cultural groups, in addition to an eighth burial ground for felons.

As the area is fragile, entrance to the East Perth Cemeteries (now maintained by the National Trust of Western Australia) is only on Sundays between 2pm and 4pm. There is an entrance fee of $10 for adults. However, it is well worth a visit as it is one of a rare surviving group of colonial cemeteries that have retained a high degree of integrity and authenticity within the CBD of an Australian capital city.

The locations of this Adventure Lab are all outside the cemetery fence perimeter, accessible 24/7.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Spark-gap transmitters were the first type of radio transmitter, and were the main type used during the wireless telegraphy or "spark" era, the first three decades of radio, from 1887 to the end of World War I. German physicist Heinrich Hertz built the first experimental spark-gap transmitters in 1887, with which he proved the existence of radio waves and studied their properties.

A fundamental limitation of spark-gap transmitters is that they generate a series of brief transient pulses of radio waves called damped waves; they are unable to produce the continuous waves used to carry audio (sound) in modern AM or FM radio transmission. So spark-gap transmitters could not transmit audio, and instead transmitted information by radiotelegraphy; the operator switched the transmitter on and off with a telegraph key, creating pulses of radio waves to spell out text messages in Morse code.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/3450fb1f-8d22-4efe-9c6e-36fa300036ab" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At a recent geocaching event at Wireless Hill it was noticed that various tables and seats had symbols embedded on them that once translated detail information relating to the original European purpose of Wireless Hill.

This Adventure takes you around 5 of the seats.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Also known as Yagans Lookout, this area has always been a significant place for communication by the Beeliar Nyoongars. In days gone by, fires were used for communication often at times when fish were moving along the Swan River.

In 1912, the Wireless Hill Station was built here, one of Australia's first telecommunication stations, using Morse Code to communicate with ships off the Australian coast using 112 metre tall mast.

In 1968 the Station was vacated and it is now listed on the Western Australian Register of Heritage Places.

The park now boasts BBQ's, Toilets, a Nature Playspace, Museum, heritage trails, some fantastic geocaches and a lookout to the CBD.

The Museum building is located within the old Engine Room of the original Wireless Station established in 1912. The Wireless Station was one of Australia’s first links with radio technology, used for telecommunications during World War One and World War Two.

Using Morse code, the Station communicated with ships off the Australian coast using a mast that was 120 metres (396 feet) tall. In 1968 the Wireless Station was vacated and it is now listed on the Western Australian Register of Heritage Places. 

The museum features several radio sets and describes the role they played in the defence of Australia and also providing essential communication links for organisations such as the Royal Flying Doctor Service.

There are many military museums from Albany in the South, Broome in the North, and Kalgoorlie in the East. 

This series looks at some of the local military sites in the Perth area, which includes World War II Tunnels, local Telecommunications, Spitfires, Tanks and Artillery. 

Most museums have restricted opening hours, however the WWII Tunnels and tours of HMAS Ovens are temporarily suspended due to Covid-19. 

Important: 
The WWII Tunnels location in Mosman Park will take some physical effort to reach the site, however there is a path for wheelchairs and people with walking aides. Please follow the Directional Signs from the Boundary Road Carpark to the Heritage Site - approximately 350 metres.

According to the plaque, the statue stands as a universal symbol of humanity’s hope that one day the dream of world peace shall inundate the entire world.

The plaque reads “May all who view the statue in this tranquil natural setting of the Scented Gardens, by the banks of the Swan River, be inspired to meditate and reflect on peace.”

This is lovely place to sit in the shade and rest before you continue on with this Adventure Lab tour of the southern shores of Perth Water.

The tour is best done by walking or cycling, although it is possible to drive from site to site even though that would be defeating the purpose. You can start at either end, or wherever you choose. This Adventure Lab does not require you to visit the sites in any ordered sequence.

The pathways along the foreshore provide outstanding views across Perth Water to the city. Along the way you’ll be able to learn a bit about various activities and land uses that occurred on and near the South Perth foreshore over the years.

Please note that some of the paths are for cyclists only, and some are for pedestrians only. The length of the tour is about 4.7km (if walking) from the Causeway bridge to the Narrows (one way) and a little bit more if cycling. There are plenty of opportunities for rest and refreshments along the way.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

As there were no adequate roads for transportation of materials to the site.  Ferries were still the main source of public and commercial transport to and from Perth so the construction materials were landed at 'German Jetty' on the foreshore below Wireless Hill.  (German Jetty is a location on the Melville Historical Places Adventure Lab.)

On 30th September, 1912 Applecross Wireless Station (Radio Perth POP) officially opened.

The skate park takes up an area of 1,200 square metre and includes basketball area, natureplay, shade shelters and amenities. The park is surrounded by 
paperbark Melaleuca raphiophylla and Flooded Gum Eucalyptus rudis and other wetland plant species. The area has a seasonally high water table and planted swales have been incorporated to allow hydrological and fauna movement through the site and to accommodate increased stormwater runoff from the skate park’s concrete surfaces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/ceffc579-0079-4b5f-a7e7-f423f8052655" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Bibra Lake.
Bibra Lake is fourth lake (going north to south) of a string of lakes which combined comprise the Beeliar Regional Park. Bibra Lake has many environmental, heritage and recreational values. Bibra Lake was first known as "Walliabup" but was later named "Bibra" after Benedict von Bibra who brought land in the area in 1843. 
Bibra lake has an interesting history of supporting a dairy farm, post office ,orchard and market garden. It was also home to a battery attached to the 66 Searchlight stationed here in World War 2 along with the regimental headquarters of the 116 Light Anti-Aircraft. This was the base for many women who served in the Australian Women's Army Service.
Today Bibra Lake offers many recreational activities whilst also providing a conservation reserve for our birds and wildlife. This Adventure Lab will take you on a tour of the area and can be completed by walking, riding or by taking the car but to really enjoy the area we recommend making use of the bike path.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Also known as Yagans Lookout, this area has always been a significant place for communication by the Beeliar Nyoongars. In days gone by, fires were used for communication often at times when fish were moving along the Swan River.

In 1912, the Wireless Hill Station was built here, one of Australia's first telecommunication stations, using Morse Code to communicate with ships off the Australian coast using 112 metre tall mast.

In 1968 the Station was vacated and it is now listed on the Western Australian Register of Heritage Places.

The park now boasts BBQ's, Toilets, a Nature Playspace, Museum, heritage trails, some fantastic geocaches and a lookout to the CBD.

Thomas was born in 1824, in Cornwall England. He married Mary in 1850 and they went on to have four children. 

Tragically, Thomas and Mary, as well as their youngest child Annie all died within months of each other in 1899. Their causes of death were not recorded. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/957e74de-66e9-479e-81ab-7b42c23a772e" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The East Perth Cemeteries is a highly significant heritage place. From tuberculosis (brought to the colony from the Old World) to typhoid (a fever that struck Perth at the same time as gold fever), the graves of East Perth Cemeteries are a record of the first 70 years of European migration to what is now Perth. It is a remnant of what was seven independently owned and managed cemeteries covering seven religious/cultural groups, in addition to an eighth burial ground for felons.

As the area is fragile, entrance to the East Perth Cemeteries (now maintained by the National Trust of Western Australia) is only on Sundays between 2pm and 4pm. There is an entrance fee of $10 for adults. However, it is well worth a visit as it is one of a rare surviving group of colonial cemeteries that have retained a high degree of integrity and authenticity within the CBD of an Australian capital city.

The locations of this Adventure Lab are all outside the cemetery fence perimeter, accessible 24/7.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Morse code is formatted as a series of on-off tones, lights, or clicks which can be easily decoded by a skilled 'listener' without the use of any additional special equipment. 

Each of these characters is represented as the standardized sequences of short and long signals (often called "dots" and "dashes", or "dits" and "dahs"), with a duration of a long signal being three times longer than the short one. 

The separation between each character is maintained with a small period of silence that is equal to the length of the short sound (or dot). Not only that Morse code is very easy to be used, but it is also very efficient. 

The original code created by the Samuel Morse and Alfred Vail in early 1840s was the predecessor to the modern International Morse Code.

After having established his reputation as a portrait painter, in his middle age Morse contributed to the invention of a single-wire telegraph system based on European telegraphs. He was a co-developer of Morse code and helped to develop the commercial use of telegraphy.

It is thought that about 30 people were buried in the Hebrew Cemetery before Karrakatta Cemetery came into use in 1899. The area fell into decline and was redeveloped with the help of the Jewish community in the 1950s.

Eight surviving headstones were eventually relocated to the Jewish Memorial Cemetery, opened in 2001, which lies on the site of the original Hebrew Cemetery. 

At this location, you will be at the front gates to the cemetery. Look through the fence towards the headstones &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/957e74de-66e9-479e-81ab-7b42c23a772e" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The East Perth Cemeteries is a highly significant heritage place. From tuberculosis (brought to the colony from the Old World) to typhoid (a fever that struck Perth at the same time as gold fever), the graves of East Perth Cemeteries are a record of the first 70 years of European migration to what is now Perth. It is a remnant of what was seven independently owned and managed cemeteries covering seven religious/cultural groups, in addition to an eighth burial ground for felons.

As the area is fragile, entrance to the East Perth Cemeteries (now maintained by the National Trust of Western Australia) is only on Sundays between 2pm and 4pm. There is an entrance fee of $10 for adults. However, it is well worth a visit as it is one of a rare surviving group of colonial cemeteries that have retained a high degree of integrity and authenticity within the CBD of an Australian capital city.

The locations of this Adventure Lab are all outside the cemetery fence perimeter, accessible 24/7.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Located on an elevated peninsula above Claisebrook Cove, these gardens were one of the earliest public parks in Perth and offer stunning views of the Swan River and its surrounds together with a variety of artworks that celebrate Indigenous history and the early culture of this area.  All five locations can be found within the immediate vicinity and can be done in any order as you stroll to  all corners of the park.

It was here that the mast and other materials for the construction of the Applecross Wireless Station were landed, and then carted up the hill.  The station commenced operations in 1912.

There were no adequate roads for transportation of materials to the site.  Ferries were still the main source of public and commercial transport to and from Perth.

After the construction of Applecross Wireless Station the jetty was used for recreational pursuits for a number of decades.

The remains of the jetty were demolished in 1965.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/2e5c1644-f91d-452f-826e-26100c031ecd" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Melville has had a long association with the Swan River that borders its northern boundaries.

This adventure takes you on a trip along the Swan River visiting some historical places of interest along the way.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

The Windsor is sited to take advantage of patrons visiting Perth Zoo, coming via ferry along the Swan River. Since its construction, the hotel has had several major renovations.

The Perth Mint was Established on 20 June 1899, two years before Australia's Federation in 1901, it was built to refine gold from the gold rushes and to mint gold sovereigns and half-sovereigns for the British Empire. 
Along with the Royal Australian mint the Perth Mint is the older of the two mints issuing coins that are legal tender in Australia.

The tour here is well worth it, they conduct tours every sixty minutes, each day, beginning from 9:30 am, with the last tour starting at 3:30 pm&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/2b086e18-1940-4fa8-ae54-650e6f68b64d" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This adventure takes you on a tour in the Perth CBD.

This tour takes advantage of the free to ride Red Cat Bus route, there are historic buildings, side tours, museums and parkland to checkout along the way.

If you are driving to the CBD, the adventure can be completed in any order, so just park up and hop on the bus anywhere along the route.
However I recommend catching the train into Perth CBD and commencing the adventure at the Red Cat Bus stop 24 - Wellington St Perth Station. From this stop the first location is St Mary's Cathedral.

P. Matheson in 1897 as a gift to the State Governor in 1897, but the Governor declined to accept it. The house became the Hotel  Melville and had many owners.  The  Stack  family purchased the Hotel in 1924 and renamed it  'Majestic  Hotel'  in 1925.  The Stack family ran the  Hotel until 1981.  The Hotel was also used as a  residence for prominent identities. 

Point Dundas is now subdivided and developed as residential lots. There is no physical trace of the original house nor the Hotel.  The modern Boardwalk around the base of the high ground of the Point is a timber  deck and handrail on timber sub-frame  into  the  foreshore.  The  Applecross Jetty is  a  timber-decked   narrow  walkway  supported  on  timber  framing,  a timber handrail, and piles into the Swan River.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/2e5c1644-f91d-452f-826e-26100c031ecd" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Melville has had a long association with the Swan River that borders its northern boundaries.

He was a renowned explorer, and a Member of Western Australia's Legislative and Executive Councils for nearly 40 years. The sites of Perth and Fremantle were chosen on his recommendation, and he was responsible for laying out the towns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/c9e4a474-ff9e-4510-a2cb-0ea70769e8a1" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1989 the Western Australian state government established a "Percent for Art" policy. The scheme, administered by the Department of Culture and the Arts, requires that up to one percent of the construction budget for new public works over $2,000,000, be expended on public artwork.

Over 700 works have been installed under the state government scheme since 1989.

This tour will take you to only 10 scattered around the Perth CBD.  All should be easy to locate along with the necessary information to complete each of the sites.

the wild life. If you are lucky enough you may even spot a turtle or two.

Bibra Lake was first known as "Walliabup" but was later named "Bibra" after Benedict von Bibra who brought land in the area in 1843. 
Bibra lake has an interesting history of supporting a dairy farm, post office ,orchard and market garden. It was also home to a battery attached to the 66 Searchlight stationed here in World War 2 along with the regimental headquarters of the 116 Light Anti-Aircraft. This was the base for many women who served in the Australian Women's Army Service.
Today Bibra Lake offers many recreational activities whilst also providing a conservation reserve for our birds and wildlife. This Adventure Lab will take you on a tour of the area and can be completed by walking, riding or by taking the car but to really enjoy the area we recommend making use of the bike path.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

It was the first Catholic Church and would become the first Cathedral. It was the centre of Catholic life for the first twenty years of the Catholic Church in the Swan River Colony until the first St Mary’s Cathedral was completed in 1865.

St John's Pro Cathedral was the principal place of worship for the Roman Catholic community in Perth from 1844 until 1865. Upon its completion in 1865 the Gothic-style St Mary's Cathedral replaced St John's as Perth's Catholic cathedral. The church then became known as St John's Pro Cathedral and was used by the Christian Brothers as a school.

In 1881, St John's Pro Cathedral was renovated and used by the Sisters of Mercy, under the name of St John's Chapel, as the school chapel for Mercedes College. 

Between 1979 and 1980, work was undertaken to restore the building . The building was then adapted for use as a museum by the Catholic Church.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/e7d9b778-67c6-4a21-a9fb-ddb8b59f71d1" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The city of Perth has its origins in 1829 when the Swan River Colony was established by the British Government. The first colonial Governor, Capt James Stirling, named the new settlement after the Scottish birthplace and parliamentary constituency of the then British Secretary of State for the Colonies, Sir George Murray. When surveying the area previously, Captain Stirling was said to have been stunned by the beauty of the Swan River and the fertile land around it.

Since water transport was vital to communications in the new colony before roads were built, the meanderings of the Swan River determined the site of the first towns. Governor Stirling decided that the site for the colony’s capital would be sited on the river 18km from the sea port of Fremantle. On 12 August 1829 Mrs Helen Dance, wife of the commander of HMS Sulphur, drove an axe into a tree to mark the colony’s foundation.

The city site was mid-way between the sea and the farming areas of the Upper Swan.

The Wadjuk boodjar was shaped by the powerful spirit beings that are looking after boodjar today. The Waugals, the giant rainbow snake spirits are the creator of the rivers, their trails all connect together forming the shape of the boodjar. 

The wirn (spirit beings) watch over the boodjar, the Waugal is the guardian of all the fresh water sources, and if not respected will make trouble for the people. 

Their belief was that if a stranger was travelling through and thought I might get a drink, when he got there it was too dirty to drink. The Waugal would dirty the water up so he can’t drink. He wouldn’t let him drink at the well because it wasn’t the right person, it wasn’t his tribe. If someone was going through and they spoke to the family, and said we would like to have a drink out of your water, could you tell the Waugal, you could get a drink of cool water, clean water.

This area, near the lowest and easiest crossing point on the Swan River (at Matagarup), was an important communication and trade centre between the coast and the islands. Whadjuck/Balardong custodian Tom Bennell referred to Perth as ”Beerit” meaning ”pathways” due to its importance for meetings, travel and trade.

This Adventure Lab Cache will take you on an approximate 12km journey around Wadjuk Boodjar  depending on the route you take, you may walk, ride, drive (parts) or use public transport to get around, we recommend you give yourself a good half of a day to complete the adventure.

St Mary's Cathedral is the largest and most grand of all of Perth's cathedrals. 

Originally built in 1865, the cathedral has undergone three separate expansions throughout its life. The largest expansion began in 1926 and was only completed in 2009, making it the longest single construction project in Western Australia's history. 
It has been the seat of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Perth for over 150 years. 

Public Tours of St Mary's Cathedral are conducted every Tuesday morning from 10:30 AM-11:30 AM.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/2b086e18-1940-4fa8-ae54-650e6f68b64d" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This adventure takes you on a tour in the Perth CBD.

This tour takes advantage of the free to ride Red Cat Bus route, there are historic buildings, side tours, museums and parkland to checkout along the way.

If you are driving to the CBD, the adventure can be completed in any order, so just park up and hop on the bus anywhere along the route.
However I recommend catching the train into Perth CBD and commencing the adventure at the Red Cat Bus stop 24 - Wellington St Perth Station. From this stop the first location is St Mary's Cathedral.

‘The yanjid was a thing that you could eat as well, the bottom roots of it. But you could only do it in seasonal turns, not every day of the week. If you pulled it out certain times, it would cause storms. 
Big storms would come. That was the aboriginals ways of acknowledging that rains were going to come.
The fires were used for clearing the area so food can be plentiful the following year.’

Karla is an integral part of Wadjuk Noongar existence, highly symbolic, in Noongar karla means campfire, it also implies the home where people gather to meet around the fire. The Wadjuk Noongar were fire-stick farmers and only Wadjuk Noongars with responsibility for boodjar could burn it. 

Today the site is consumed by health, mental and religious facilities.

This tree is 120+ years old with a 3m diameter and height of 36m.
Significance: the tree is a landmark in the street and is associated with the historical buildings of Royal Perth Hospital.
History: the tree was planted between 1890 and the early 1900’s although the exact date and person/persons are unknown it is a dominant feature and dictates the flow of traffic. It is also known as the Kissing Tree as the nurses from the nearby hospital would say goodbye to their sweethearts before entering their quarters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/c378ab2c-ff17-4c4b-b2ae-c27b615e8f45" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The National Trusts of Australia are community based, non government organisations, committed to promoting and conserving Australia’s indigenous, natural and historic heritage places and objects. The National Trusts of Australia are collaborating to create a national register of significant trees, which is consistent with their mission to protect and celebrate Australia’s heritage. There are over 2,500 significant tree records compiled over thirty years across Australia. 
This adventure lab focuses on five trees 100+ years of age. 
Jarrah Tree - Armadale: Historic value; at 1500+ years, this tree reflects the great age of the species and is a significant remnant of the period prior to European colonisation.
Scientific value; the girth and age of this Eucalyptus margin at a makes it valuable as a benchmark site with potential to contribute to future research. Unfortunately it has been significantly impacted by development and vandalism.

Designed for solicitors Septimus Burt and Edward Stone, it was erected next to their office on Howick Street (now called Hay Street). The first performance took place on 4 December 1879, a melodrama called ‘The Colleen Bawn’ performed by local amateur actors. The inspiration for the design is said to be the Lyceum Theatre in London. 

After most of the hall was demolished in the 1980s, only the façade remained. In  2008 the District Court Building was constructed behind the portico, and the architects of the new building have interpreted the St George’s Hall’s history at the entrance to the registry hall. 

The coordinates will take you to a plaque east of the facade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/3ac167c3-0dba-4363-bb05-0e8eac02c57a" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Since the time of Settlement, the Perth CBD has been home to a vibrant theatre scene and this short Adventure Lab will take you to some of this city’s key live performance locations, both historical and current. The seven locations are in close proximity and you should easily be able to complete the series within two hours. Take your time to appreciate some of the wonderful architecture of the contemporary theatres as well as the remnants of those lost to development. 

Given the building density within this area, the listed coordinates may not be as accurate as desired. However there should be sufficient information in each location’s description for you to find what you need once you have navigated to the general area.

This camp is particularly important to the Wadjuk Noongar because it is the location of their karla (home fire), the place they call home. Byerbrup is the home of Wadjuk Noongar leader Yellagonga and his family.

The area known as Byerbrup begins from the western side of the Convection Centre and runs all the way through Spring Street to where the Western Australian Parliament stands.

Once described by a wedjela called John Watson as ‘one of the beauty-spots of those days, plenty of Jarrah trees and gums were around a large pool of water that was always overflowing from the spring.’

In Djeran (in Autumn) the Noongar people would come to the area to feast, at other times they would come to the area to trade items, now this area is a very busy hub for Perth City.

This area, near the lowest and easiest crossing point on the Swan River (at Matagarup), was an important communication and trade centre between the coast and the islands. Whadjuck/Balardong custodian Tom Bennell referred to Perth as ”Beerit” meaning ”pathways” due to its importance for meetings, travel and trade.

This Adventure Lab Cache will take you on an approximate 12km journey around Wadjuk Boodjar  depending on the route you take, you may walk, ride, drive (parts) or use public transport to get around, we recommend you give yourself a good half of a day to complete the adventure.

Before the Old Court House was opened in 1837, a temporary ‘rush church’ on the corner of Hay and Irwin Streets had doubled as place of worship and court.

This tradition of multiple use was continued when Perth’s civil engineer, Henry Reveley, was tasked with designing “a suitable building as a court-house which could likewise be appropriated to the uses of a temporary church”. He drew up plans for a simple building with a distinctive Doric entrance, and construction started in 1836.

Opening on Good Friday, 24 March 1837, for worship, the Old Court House started hearing law cases the following morning. Sometimes the school which also used the room had to be interrupted if an important case was to be heard.

Head down the left side of the building past the side entrance to just before the fence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/7ba2105b-269b-4f75-9d77-8a158e9cdf1e" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Take a trip visiting the early European history of the Western Australia colony.

Indigenous Australians have been occupying Western Australia for around 40,000 to 60,000 years.

The first recorded European contact was in 1616 when Dutch explorer Dirk Hartog landed on the west coast but the first permanent settlement was not made until 1826 when a settlement was established at Albany to formally take possession of the western third of the continent of Australia for the British Crown.  The Swan River Colony was established in 1829 starting the official history of European settlement of Western Australia.

This set of lab caches explores the early buildings and places of the Swan River Colony.

In the early days of the Swan River Colony, judicial hearings took place in the ‘Rush Church’, a temporary church set up on the corner of Hay and Irwin Streets, but in 1836, a courthouse was built to a design by Henry Revely. Described by Revely as "chaste and appropriate", the building cost £698 and the first Court of General Quarter Sessions was held there on 2 January 1837. For the first few years of its life, the building not only served as a court room, but also the Colony’s theatre, concert hall, school and church. Today, the building houses the Old Court House Law Museum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/e7d9b778-67c6-4a21-a9fb-ddb8b59f71d1" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The city of Perth has its origins in 1829 when the Swan River Colony was established by the British Government. The first colonial Governor, Capt James Stirling, named the new settlement after the Scottish birthplace and parliamentary constituency of the then British Secretary of State for the Colonies, Sir George Murray. When surveying the area previously, Captain Stirling was said to have been stunned by the beauty of the Swan River and the fertile land around it.

Since water transport was vital to communications in the new colony before roads were built, the meanderings of the Swan River determined the site of the first towns. Governor Stirling decided that the site for the colony’s capital would be sited on the river 18km from the sea port of Fremantle. On 12 August 1829 Mrs Helen Dance, wife of the commander of HMS Sulphur, drove an axe into a tree to mark the colony’s foundation.

The city site was mid-way between the sea and the farming areas of the Upper Swan.

It was demolished in October 2012 as part of a redevelopment of Cathedral Square. The site is now occupied by office buildings. 

The Playhouse was the home of the National Theatre Company (née Repertory Theatre Club),  the Playhouse Theatre Company (1984-85), the West Australian Theatre Company (1985-91) and the Perth Theatre Company (1995 - 2009).

The coordinates will take you to an inscription in the new building’s stone wall facing Pier St.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/3ac167c3-0dba-4363-bb05-0e8eac02c57a" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Since the time of Settlement, the Perth CBD has been home to a vibrant theatre scene and this short Adventure Lab will take you to some of this city’s key live performance locations, both historical and current. The seven locations are in close proximity and you should easily be able to complete the series within two hours. Take your time to appreciate some of the wonderful architecture of the contemporary theatres as well as the remnants of those lost to development. 

Given the building density within this area, the listed coordinates may not be as accurate as desired. However there should be sufficient information in each location’s description for you to find what you need once you have navigated to the general area. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

In 1937 the old Criterion Hotel was completely replaced by the Art Deco building which still stands on Hay Street today. Then owned by the Swan Brewery, the new hotel was described as an up-to-date building ‘in keeping with the times’. 

To a design by well-known architects Hobbs, Forbes and Partners, the cost of the new building was £42,000, and furniture and furnishings involved an outlay of over £7,000.
 All the furnishing was provided by Boans, which had established itself as the only Perth company able to undertake such large-scale jobs.

Today, the Criterion Hotel continues to provide accommodation for visitors to Perth, as well as being a tourist attraction as one of the most impressive Art Deco buildings in the city centre.

Oral history interviews with David (Walter Atwell’s second son), his wife Connie and their daughter Dianne in 1998 provide a detailed description of the house, its furnishings and the lifestyle of the family.  From the  interviews, it is clear that Atwell House was designed to show the prominence of its owners, being a substantial brick and tile residence for the time with an elaborate verandah, bay windows and leadlight window and door features. 

On 29 May 1982, Mayor of Melville, J.F. Howson Esq. OBE JP, officially opened the MCAA’s  Atwell Studio Gallery building.This was constructed for the purposes of providing a gallery space for the permanent  display of the artwork created by Association members.  The building was specifically designed to match  the scale, style and materials of the adjacent Atwell House.

The five 3.5m high cast aluminium pen nibs are dedicated to the planners who designed the Stirling Gardens (Western Australia's first Botanical Garden). It also honours those who wrote the recorded history of the gardens.

This sculpture `Memory Markers` was inspired by the early recording of memories about Stirling Gardens. The shapes are based on the familiar ink dipping nib which expresses the essence of the Victorian Era on which the original formal planting patterns were based.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/c9e4a474-ff9e-4510-a2cb-0ea70769e8a1" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1989 the Western Australian state government established a "Percent for Art" policy. The scheme, administered by the Department of Culture and the Arts, requires that up to one percent of the construction budget for new public works over $2,000,000, be expended on public artwork.

Over 700 works have been installed under the state government scheme since 1989.

This tour will take you to only 10 scattered around the Perth CBD.  All should be easy to locate along with the necessary information to complete each of the sites.

Travelers of the past used road distances and road maps to find their way around.  Each state of Australia had their 'Point Zero' to measure road distances from a central point.

Unlike most states where road distances were measured from the General Post Office located in the state capital city the road distances in Western Australia from 1925 were measured from the corner of the building where the Point Zero plaque is on display.

NE of the Point Zero plaque is a sculpture in the St George's Cathedral lawn area.

A leading or founding member of many social reform groups, such as the Women's Service Guilds, The Australian Federation of Women Voters and their periodical The Dawn, she sought to establish international campaigns for social change and human rights.

Rischbieth promoted a Citizens Committee for the Preservation of Kings Park and the Swan River and successfully prevented an olympic swimming pool being built for the 1962 Empire Games in Kings Park.

She remained active in social issues until her death at Bethesda Hospital in Claremont, Western Australia on 13 March 1967, aged 92.

Bibra Lake is fourth lake (going north to south) of a string of lakes which combined comprise the Beeliar Regional Park. Bibra Lake has many environmental, heritage and recreational values. Bibra Lake was first known as "Walliabup" but was later named "Bibra" after Benedict von Bibra who brought land in the area in 1843. 
Bibra lake has an interesting history of supporting a dairy farm, post office ,orchard and market garden. It was also home to a battery attached to the 66 Searchlight stationed here in World War 2 along with the regimental headquarters of the 116 Light Anti-Aircraft. This was the base for many women who served in the Australian Women's Army Service.
Today Bibra Lake offers many recreational activities whilst also providing a conservation reserve for our birds and wildlife. This Adventure Lab will take you on a tour of the area and can be completed by walking, riding or by taking the car but to really enjoy the area we recommend making use of the bike path.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

The library is the first civic building to be built by the City of Perth since the Perth Concert Hall in 1972, It was completed in 2016. 
It is well worth exploring the building, you will discover many interesting aspects, such as the ceiling features a mural by artist Andrew Nicholls, there is a 13 meter tall vertical garden, the tallest in Perth, with more than 3500 plants! It also has an outdoor terrace and free wifi.

This tour takes advantage of the free to ride Red Cat Bus route, there are historic buildings, side tours, museums and parkland to checkout along the way.

If you are driving to the CBD, the adventure can be completed in any order, so just park up and hop on the bus anywhere along the route.
However I recommend catching the train into Perth CBD and commencing the adventure at the Red Cat Bus stop 24 - Wellington St Perth Station. From this stop the first location is St Mary's Cathedral.

As Australia marched toward Federation, the promise of a transcontinental railway to link the isolated west with the fast growing east coast persuaded Western Australia to align with the rest of the colonies. At the time, a skeleton rail link existed but the west to east line was missing a section between Kalgoorlie and Port Augusta spanning almost 2000 kilometres.
1912 – 1917
In one of Australia’s most remarkable surveying and engineering feats, two construction teams worked for more than five years to fill the 2000 kilometre gap. On 17 October 1917, the two construction teams – one starting from Port Augusta and other from Kalgoorlie – finally met after working for five years on what is the longest straight stretch of railway ever built in Australia. It was constructed using the most basic tools – pick and shovel, carthorse and camel. The teams joined the line at what is now known as the tiny South Australian siding of Ooldea on the Nullarbor Plain.

They each had one first class and two second class compartments, seating 22 passengers (six in first class and sixteen in second class). First class had comfortable padded seats. Second class had wooden benches. Lighting was by oil lamps. The coachwork and frame was made of teak and the interior and roof was made of pine. Each coach was 4.9 metres long, 2.3 metres wide, 3.2 metres high and weighed 4.25 tonnes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/29448b92-ccf2-4fed-9423-76f521005c21" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1890s
As Australia marched toward Federation, the promise of a transcontinental railway to link the isolated west with the fast growing east coast persuaded Western Australia to align with the rest of the colonies. At the time, a skeleton rail link existed but the west to east line was missing a section between Kalgoorlie and Port Augusta spanning almost 2000 kilometres.
1912 – 1917
In one of Australia’s most remarkable surveying and engineering feats, two construction teams worked for more than five years to fill the 2000 kilometre gap. On 17 October 1917, the two construction teams – one starting from Port Augusta and other from Kalgoorlie – finally met after working for five years on what is the longest straight stretch of railway ever built in Australia. It was constructed using the most basic tools – pick and shovel, carthorse and camel. The teams joined the line at what is now known as the tiny South Australian siding of Ooldea on the Nullarbor Plain.

It was not until 1969 that an uninterrupted rail link from the Indian Ocean in the west to the Pacific Ocean in the east existed. The newly named Indian Pacific train embarked on its inaugural transcontinental journey on 23 February 1970, arriving in Perth. It is this rich history that has made the Indian Pacific one of Australia’s most treasured icons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/29448b92-ccf2-4fed-9423-76f521005c21" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1890s

The oldest piece of brickwork in the city is behind the Barrack Street section of the old Central Government Offices, known to many as the ‘Old Treasury Building’, but now named the ‘State Buildings’. The site was originally the barracks for the 63rd Regiment (sent here to protect the new colony), who, in 1833, built a guard house facing Barrack Street. When the first section of the Central Government Offices was built in 1875, it incorporated this guard house, which was initially used as the Police Court.  During the recent adaptation of the Central Government Offices, a small section of brickwork from the original guard house was revealed in the back wall at ground floor level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/e7d9b778-67c6-4a21-a9fb-ddb8b59f71d1" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The city of Perth has its origins in 1829 when the Swan River Colony was established by the British Government. The first colonial Governor, Capt James Stirling, named the new settlement after the Scottish birthplace and parliamentary constituency of the then British Secretary of State for the Colonies, Sir George Murray. When surveying the area previously, Captain Stirling was said to have been stunned by the beauty of the Swan River and the fertile land around it.

Since water transport was vital to communications in the new colony before roads were built, the meanderings of the Swan River determined the site of the first towns. Governor Stirling decided that the site for the colony’s capital would be sited on the river 18km from the sea port of Fremantle. On 12 August 1829 Mrs Helen Dance, wife of the commander of HMS Sulphur, drove an axe into a tree to mark the colony’s foundation.

The city site was mid-way between the sea and the farming areas of the Upper Swan.

The foundation was laid on 24 May 1867 by Governor Hampton, but it was not opened until 1 June 1870 by Governor Weld. The design was a joint production of James Manning and Richard Roach Jewell. Manning was responsible for all of the woodwork, including the magnificent roof, while Jewell designed and supervised the erection of the main building.

In addition to Council activities, the Town Hall has also hosted concerts, exhibitions, bazaars, lectures, dances, skating, and stage shows. It was also the place that generations gathered every 31 December to hear the New Year rung in by the bells of its clock.

It is near this spot that the felling of a tree marked the foundation of the City on 12th August 1829.

Look for the exposed foundations on the David Malcolm Justice Centre side (south side) of the town hall heading west away from Barrack Street.   Above them are two plaques on the wall.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/7ba2105b-269b-4f75-9d77-8a158e9cdf1e" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Take a trip visiting the early European history of the Western Australia colony.

Indigenous Australians have been occupying Western Australia for around 40,000 to 60,000 years.

The first recorded European contact was in 1616 when Dutch explorer Dirk Hartog landed on the west coast but the first permanent settlement was not made until 1826 when a settlement was established at Albany to formally take possession of the western third of the continent of Australia for the British Crown.  The Swan River Colony was established in 1829 starting the official history of European settlement of Western Australia.

This set of lab caches explores the early buildings and places of the Swan River Colony.

Since the beginning of the 20th century the standardisation of the railway gauge throughout Australia received the investigation and consideration which such an important national problem deserved. However, apart from the Trans Australian Railway, completed in 1917 as a Federation commitment, little was achieved. In 1912 the Commonwealth Government proposed a standard gauge (4 ft 8½ in or 1435 mm) railway from Fremantle to Kalgoorlie, to be completed at the same time as the Trans Australian Railway, but it did not proceed due to a lack of finance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/29448b92-ccf2-4fed-9423-76f521005c21" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1890s

Perth Town Hall is Australia's only Gothic style town Hall. It was not specifically designed as a Council chamber or administration center, but rather as an all-purpose meeting place for the people of Perth.

The coloured bricks came from the East Perth clay pits (now ornamental ponds at Queen’s Gardens) and were laid in chequered Flemish bond. Free settlers laid the foundations for the Hall and then convicts completed the building.

The Hall is open to the public from 10am to 4pm, Monday to Saturday, unless hired for a private function. 
It is well worth taking a look inside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/2b086e18-1940-4fa8-ae54-650e6f68b64d" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This adventure takes you on a tour in the Perth CBD.

This tour takes advantage of the free to ride Red Cat Bus route, there are historic buildings, side tours, museums and parkland to checkout along the way.

If you are driving to the CBD, the adventure can be completed in any order, so just park up and hop on the bus anywhere along the route.
However I recommend catching the train into Perth CBD and commencing the adventure at the Red Cat Bus stop 24 - Wellington St Perth Station. From this stop the first location is St Mary's Cathedral.

First Contact by _____ _____
‘They first saw a boat with white sails coming to shore, which they haven’t seen before, you know it would have looked like a big white bird, and the sailors being Wadjellas, made the noongar people think it was their ancestor’s spirits coming back from the dead, from the sea.’

This area, near the lowest and easiest crossing point on the Swan River (at Matagarup), was an important communication and trade centre between the coast and the islands. Whadjuck/Balardong custodian Tom Bennell referred to Perth as ”Beerit” meaning ”pathways” due to its importance for meetings, travel and trade.

This Adventure Lab Cache will take you on an approximate 12km journey around Wadjuk Boodjar  depending on the route you take, you may walk, ride, drive (parts) or use public transport to get around, we recommend you give yourself a good half of a day to complete the adventure.

Inspired by the fact that St. Martins Centre occupies the site of the first businessman`s club of WA, this public artwork recognises their involvement on significant historical moments during Perth`s development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/c9e4a474-ff9e-4510-a2cb-0ea70769e8a1" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1989 the Western Australian state government established a "Percent for Art" policy. The scheme, administered by the Department of Culture and the Arts, requires that up to one percent of the construction budget for new public works over $2,000,000, be expended on public artwork.

Over 700 works have been installed under the state government scheme since 1989.

This tour will take you to only 10 scattered around the Perth CBD.  All should be easy to locate along with the necessary information to complete each of the sites.

As Australia marched toward Federation, the promise of a transcontinental railway to link the isolated west with the fast growing east coast persuaded Western Australia to align with the rest of the colonies. At the time, a skeleton rail link existed but the west to east line was missing a section between Kalgoorlie and Port Augusta spanning almost 2000 kilometres.
1912 – 1917
In one of Australia’s most remarkable surveying and engineering feats, two construction teams worked for more than five years to fill the 2000 kilometre gap. On 17 October 1917, the two construction teams – one starting from Port Augusta and other from Kalgoorlie – finally met after working for five years on what is the longest straight stretch of railway ever built in Australia. It was constructed using the most basic tools – pick and shovel, carthorse and camel. The teams joined the line at what is now known as the tiny South Australian siding of Ooldea on the Nullarbor Plain.

Dilhorn is associated with its first owner, William Thorley Loton, a prominent Perth identity who was involved in the commercial, cultural and political life of his times and with J. Talbot Hobbs, Dilhorn's designer, a prominent Perth architect, who was responsible for building many of Perth's grand homes at the turn of this century. It is named after his birthplace, Dilhorne in England.

Dilhorn is an elegant and confident example of a substantial Federation Queen Anne style house. The house displays many innovative and distinctive aesthetic elements that are a hallmark of J. Talbot Hobbs' domestic buildings between 1890 - 1910 and develops his architectural themes. Many of these themes were adopted in a simplified form in the mass housing market over the following twenty years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/8a6f4212-17a5-4657-ae2d-1cbf9304c1f4" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This Adventure Lab takes you a brief walk around Highgate and its surrounding suburbs, to some of the unique historical sights that I am lucky enough to pass on my daily lunch break. There are some incredible homes and buildings in the area with varying architectural styles, which create such a unique suburb with incredible character.

As you answer each question at each stage of the Adventure Lab, make sure that you note the clues to locate the bonus final cache.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Today the cemetery remains the chosen resting place of many people wishing to be buried in a traditional setting, alongside some of Western Australia’s most notable pioneers.  

An earlier cemetery in Guildford was established early in the history of the Swan River Colony in James Street and some headstones were moved to Guildford Cemetery when it was established.

It located in the southern part of Guildford, between the Great Eastern Highway Bypass and Kalamunda Road adjacent to the Perth Airport.

This Lab should take about 2 hours to complete and all sites should have good phone coverage. 

While you are visiting the various locations please take the opportunity to read a few of the headstones, finding about the area and the history of the people who are laid to rest there.  Sometimes it may give a hint as to what they did and where they originated from. 

Very importantly, please remember where you are and show the appropriate respect for the residents and people visiting them.

There is also an optional bonus mystery cache to find once you have finished.  You will need to collect the clues provided in the journals to solve the puzzle and get the cache coordinates.  

Good luck and have fun!

Performing somersaults and handstands, Percy entertained people for a few shillings while they waited to see films, newsreels and theatrical performances at the theaters that were concentrated in what is now the Hay Street Mall, the Theater Royal, the Ambassador and His Majesty's Theater.

Percy was renowned for his grubbiness and in November 1929 local newspaper, The Mirror, dressed Percy up in a long-tailed suit and ran a front page competition asking readers to guess the identity of the cleaned up man. The Mirror offered a guinea's worth of goods for the first opened letter giving the man's name. The newspaper later asked Percy to write the 1929 Centenary Christmas Message.

Then one of the city’s largest and most magnificent buildings, it was built for Thomas Molloy, builder, speculator and local politician. Although the Town Hall, St George’s Hall and, sometimes, the Swan River Mechanics’ Institute were used to stage live theatre productions, the need for a purpose-built theatre in Perth had been long felt in the community and, as a result, the news that Molloy was planning to build Perth’s first theatre was received with much enthusiasm. The Theatre Royal was opened on 19 April 1897. It should have opened the previous Saturday night, but was prevented from doing so “owing to the late arrival of S. S. Rockton with the actors and scenery on board”. The opening performance was of the ‘Silver King’ by the Stanford &amp; Barnes Company. Later in the 1980’s it became adjoined as part of Hoyts Centres Cinema Four but was closed in April 1999. 
The facade survived and the building now houses retail shops.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/3ac167c3-0dba-4363-bb05-0e8eac02c57a" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Since the time of Settlement, the Perth CBD has been home to a vibrant theatre scene and this short Adventure Lab will take you to some of this city’s key live performance locations, both historical and current. The seven locations are in close proximity and you should easily be able to complete the series within two hours. Take your time to appreciate some of the wonderful architecture of the contemporary theatres as well as the remnants of those lost to development. 

Given the building density within this area, the listed coordinates may not be as accurate as desired. However there should be sufficient information in each location’s description for you to find what you need once you have navigated to the general area. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

“Hot summer nights at the Point.

We always looked forward to crabbing. On hot steamy summer nights we piled into the family car and headed for Mill Point. We always wore old sandshoes to protect us from a nip on the toes.

The river in those days was teeming with delicious blue manna crabs, easily seen on what was then a clear river bed. Father and older brother armed themselves with scoop nets for the catch. Younger brother dragged the large metal tub along to hold the captured crabs, while I carried the hurricane lamp. We filled a large kerosene tin with water from the river and when the water was boiling, in would go the unfortunate crabs. Munching into our meal was sheer paradise and we were, with full tummies, more than pleased to leave the beach in its previous orderly state”.

The tour is best done by walking or cycling, although it is possible to drive from site to site even though that would be defeating the purpose. You can start at either end, or wherever you choose. This Adventure Lab does not require you to visit the sites in any ordered sequence.

The pathways along the foreshore provide outstanding views across Perth Water to the city. Along the way you’ll be able to learn a bit about various activities and land uses that occurred on and near the South Perth foreshore over the years.

Please note that some of the paths are for cyclists only, and some are for pedestrians only. The length of the tour is about 4.7km (if walking) from the Causeway bridge to the Narrows (one way) and a little bit more if cycling. There are plenty of opportunities for rest and refreshments along the way.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

I recommend walking here from stop 8.

London Court is a retail arcade running between Hay Street Mall and St Georges Terrace. It was built in 1937 as a combination of residential and commercial premises for wealthy gold miner and financier Claude de Bernales. The design has captured a setting and atmosphere similar to that of Tudor England. 
It features a replica of the 'Great Clock' at Rouen in France, and at the other end a replica of the 'Big Ben' clock in London. 
There are also many other interesting details and hidden features that are fun to discover.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/2b086e18-1940-4fa8-ae54-650e6f68b64d" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This adventure takes you on a tour in the Perth CBD.

This tour takes advantage of the free to ride Red Cat Bus route, there are historic buildings, side tours, museums and parkland to checkout along the way.

If you are driving to the CBD, the adventure can be completed in any order, so just park up and hop on the bus anywhere along the route.
However I recommend catching the train into Perth CBD and commencing the adventure at the Red Cat Bus stop 24 - Wellington St Perth Station. From this stop the first location is St Mary's Cathedral.

In 1904, William Loton sold the land to the City of Perth under the condition that it was set aside for recreational use. 

The tennis courts at this site were constructed in 1913-14 with the Loton Park Tennis Club established in 1916 and by 1917 it was granted permission to establish two additional courts.

The pavillion at the Tennis Club was erected in 1922 and is a fine example of the Interwar Arts and Craft style, to the design of Eales &amp; Cohen, foremost exponents of the style. Since construction it has undergone a minor extension and renovation to ensure longevity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/8a6f4212-17a5-4657-ae2d-1cbf9304c1f4" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This Adventure Lab takes you a brief walk around Highgate and its surrounding suburbs, to some of the unique historical sights that I am lucky enough to pass on my daily lunch break. There are some incredible homes and buildings in the area with varying architectural styles, which create such a unique suburb with incredible character.

As you answer each question at each stage of the Adventure Lab, make sure that you note the clues to locate the bonus final cache.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

The reserve has abundant activities for all types of people.The lake features a 6km dual use path making it perfect to explore the area on foot or by bike it also makes it easy access for wheelchairs and prams.
There are bbq's, shelters, exercise equipment, playgrounds and viewing platforms for all to enjoy. It is a lovely place for a picnic.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/ceffc579-0079-4b5f-a7e7-f423f8052655" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Bibra Lake.
Bibra Lake is fourth lake (going north to south) of a string of lakes which combined comprise the Beeliar Regional Park. Bibra Lake has many environmental, heritage and recreational values. Bibra Lake was first known as "Walliabup" but was later named "Bibra" after Benedict von Bibra who brought land in the area in 1843. 
Bibra lake has an interesting history of supporting a dairy farm, post office ,orchard and market garden. It was also home to a battery attached to the 66 Searchlight stationed here in World War 2 along with the regimental headquarters of the 116 Light Anti-Aircraft. This was the base for many women who served in the Australian Women's Army Service.
Today Bibra Lake offers many recreational activities whilst also providing a conservation reserve for our birds and wildlife. This Adventure Lab will take you on a tour of the area and can be completed by walking, riding or by taking the car but to really enjoy the area we recommend making use of the bike path.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Daisy Bates wrote of a place where a wilgi garup (ochre pit) is located in Glendalough northeast of Perth which was the property of Wadjuk Noongar boordiya yorga Fanny Balbuk (through her father’s line). Wilgi is a highly valued commodity for ceremonies used by Aboriginal people across Western Australia and was one of the items traded in this area. Wilgi from Perth has been rumoured to have travelled as far as the Yankunytjatjara Pitjantjatjara country that crosses the border into South Australia.

This area, near the lowest and easiest crossing point on the Swan River (at Matagarup), was an important communication and trade centre between the coast and the islands. Whadjuck/Balardong custodian Tom Bennell referred to Perth as ”Beerit” meaning ”pathways” due to its importance for meetings, travel and trade.

This Adventure Lab Cache will take you on an approximate 12km journey around Wadjuk Boodjar  depending on the route you take, you may walk, ride, drive (parts) or use public transport to get around, we recommend you give yourself a good half of a day to complete the adventure.

Before that it was called King's Head Hotel and was the first licensed premises in the colony.

When the Palace Hotel was opened, it was considered to be the finest hotel in the southern hemisphere. Boasting of marble stairs, electric lights, hot water, and a bathroom on every corridor, no expense had been spared for visitors.

When the Commonwealth Bank bought the place in the 1970s, it was only a hard-fought local campaign which saved the Palace from being demolished and replaced by a modern office building. After Alan Bond’s company took over the property, it was closed as a hotel and much of the interior was lost, or greatly changed, to erect a tall office block behind the facade.

You are looking for a plaque beside the St Georges Terrace entrance to the office tower.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/7ba2105b-269b-4f75-9d77-8a158e9cdf1e" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Take a trip visiting the early European history of the Western Australia colony.

Indigenous Australians have been occupying Western Australia for around 40,000 to 60,000 years.

The first recorded European contact was in 1616 when Dutch explorer Dirk Hartog landed on the west coast but the first permanent settlement was not made until 1826 when a settlement was established at Albany to formally take possession of the western third of the continent of Australia for the British Crown.  The Swan River Colony was established in 1829 starting the official history of European settlement of Western Australia.

This set of lab caches explores the early buildings and places of the Swan River Colony.

Leighton for mining entrepreneur Claude de Bernales. The theatre and arcade opened in 1938, with the arcade connecting Hay Street through to Murray Street. In 1984 the theatre and arcade underwent a significant refurbishment, with the refurbishment winning an architectural award from the Royal Australian Institute of Architecture. The theatre and arcade are classified by the National Trust of Australia and are included on the State Heritage Register. The Piccadilly Cinema was the last operating cinema in the Perth central business district before its closure in 2013 and until the opening of Raine Square's Palace Cinema in 2018. A redevelopment of the cinema space and arcade is expected to be completed in 2020.

Since the time of Settlement, the Perth CBD has been home to a vibrant theatre scene and this short Adventure Lab will take you to some of this city’s key live performance locations, both historical and current. The seven locations are in close proximity and you should easily be able to complete the series within two hours. Take your time to appreciate some of the wonderful architecture of the contemporary theatres as well as the remnants of those lost to development. 

Given the building density within this area, the listed coordinates may not be as accurate as desired. However there should be sufficient information in each location’s description for you to find what you need once you have navigated to the general area. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

It was purchased by William Loton, and was offered to the City of Perth in 1904 for use as a public recreation area, known then as Loton Park. 

Perth Oval has been one of the long term premier sporting venues in metropolitan Perth from the early 1900s until the advent of more specialised sporting venues from the mid 1980s, including interstate football matches and cricket games. More recently it has been the home of Perth Glory soccer team. 

Perth Oval entry gates are one of the state's finest examples of the Interwar Mediterranean style for recreational purposes. The mature trees of the perimeter planting are representative of the Paradise landscape style of planting that is characteristic of public parks and gardens established in Perth at the turn of the century.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/8a6f4212-17a5-4657-ae2d-1cbf9304c1f4" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This Adventure Lab takes you a brief walk around Highgate and its surrounding suburbs, to some of the unique historical sights that I am lucky enough to pass on my daily lunch break. There are some incredible homes and buildings in the area with varying architectural styles, which create such a unique suburb with incredible character.

As you answer each question at each stage of the Adventure Lab, make sure that you note the clues to locate the bonus final cache.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

I had to highlight the Western Australian Visitor Centre, It is a one stop shop for travel information, souvenirs and offers free tours about the Perth CBD.
Stop in have break and plan some more adventures.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/2b086e18-1940-4fa8-ae54-650e6f68b64d" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This adventure takes you on a tour in the Perth CBD.

This tour takes advantage of the free to ride Red Cat Bus route, there are historic buildings, side tours, museums and parkland to checkout along the way.

If you are driving to the CBD, the adventure can be completed in any order, so just park up and hop on the bus anywhere along the route.
However I recommend catching the train into Perth CBD and commencing the adventure at the Red Cat Bus stop 24 - Wellington St Perth Station. From this stop the first location is St Mary's Cathedral.

The WA government purchased the land at 196 Guildford Road for 135 pounds.

The Maylands Police Station and residential quarters was built by Franklin and Finlay at a cost of 962 pounds and opened on 9 August 1908. At that time, it was common practice to accommodate both the local Police station and quarters for the Police officers under one roof. 

The original building had a charge room and two cells. Its yard had a washhouse, earth closets and also a timber stable as the district constable was a mounted constable.  For many years, the horse drinking trough on the footpath at the front entrance served as a reminder of bygone days.

In 1973, the stables were removed and replaced with a double garage. From 1999 to 2005, a single policeman staffed the Station, and the Station eventually closed in 2007.

At the coords, you will be standing at the front gate to the premises. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/939f9691-68c6-4270-9e7c-e4f5b846c975" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Maylands Peninsula is on the northern bank of the Swan River about 5 kilometres east of Perth's city centre, and has a rich and varied history. This Adventure Lab will take you to just a few of the interesting historical buildings and locations in the area. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

The sedges, samphires and trees around this area are essential for maintaining the health of the estuary and the waterbirds.The seagrass meadows provide a nursery habitat for fish and crustaceans. Dead and decaying seagrass provides food for invertebrates that are food for waterbirds. The shallow mudflats are exposed during low tide which may only be for a few hours each day. These mudflats hide mussel deposits and are home to worms, aquatic snails, insects and other minute crustaceans sought after by waterbirds.Other waterbirds trap small fish in the open water.
This adventure is best done on a lovely bike ride which will give you beautiful views of the Swan River and the many waterbirds. See how many different species you can count!&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

According to Balardong Wadjuk Noongar boordiya Cedric Jacobs, the pinjar were essential for hunting and collecting food.

“This was a supermarket of the Noongar people.”

Food harvested depended on the season and the water levels. Popular animals are gilgie (fresh water crayfish), yaagan (turtles) and koolya (frogs).

An early settler George Grey watched Wadjuk yorga harvesting frogs and turtles. In 1841 he wrote:

“women with their long sticks, and their long thin arms, which they plunge up to the shoulder in the slime, managing to drag them out.”

Today you can see a small wetland outside the Art Gallery, frogs and lizards are returning to a place where they once thrived.

It served as a factory to manufacture cakes and confectionery for its eleven tearooms in Perth and three in Kalgoorlie/Boulder. The site chosen was 19 acres of land two miles from Perth, with natural springs that could supply 100,000 gallons of fresh water per day. The company's founder, Peter Albany Bell, used ideas derived from the Cadbury factory in Bournville, UK to incorporate superior working conditions and amenities for employees, including two weeks' paid annual leave.

After the company was closed and sold in 1928, the factory changed hands many times: becoming a chicken hatchery and, later, a reserve building for WA Newspapers Ltd during World War II. The building was heritage listed in 1991. It was eventually resold and developed into apartment accommodation, retaining the external structure and gardens.

At the coords, you'll be standing at the front gate to the complex. Look towards the building's facade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/939f9691-68c6-4270-9e7c-e4f5b846c975" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Maylands Peninsula is on the northern bank of the Swan River about 5 kilometres east of Perth's city centre, and has a rich and varied history. This Adventure Lab will take you to just a few of the interesting historical buildings and locations in the area. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

The sedges, samphires and trees around this area are essential for maintaining the health of the estuary and the waterbirds.The seagrass meadows provide a nursery habitat for fish and crustaceans. Dead and decaying seagrass provides food for invertebrates that are food for waterbirds. The shallow mudflats are exposed during low tide which may only be for a few hours each day. These mudflats hide mussel deposits and are home to worms, aquatic snails, insects and other minute crustaceans sought after by waterbirds.Other waterbirds trap small fish in the open water.
This adventure is best done on a lovely bike ride which will give you beautiful views of the Swan River and the many waterbirds. See how many different species you can count!&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

The building dates from 1896, and for 40 years was the Perth Boys' and Girls' School (one of several schools known collectively as Perth Central School). 

PICA began operating from the James Street building in 1988 with the main aim of promoting contemporary art (visual, performing or mixed) in Western Australia. It operates a year-round program of exhibitions, performances, and screenings, and offers a public education program. The Benson London clock remains as one of the original features.

Once you answer the question an older photo will pop up.
It was hard to cull my list, but I hope you enjoy wandering around the area...

30 minutes should be enough time for this walk...&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

It was built by workers in receipt of sustenance payments during the Great Depression and played a major role in the Defence and Western Australian Police Service communications, as the antennae for the wireless were camoflagued in the vent structure during the World War II.

Lincoln Street Ventilation Stack was a failure in its own right. It closed after four weeks of operation when the hydrogen sulphide, which turns to sulphuric acid on contact with water, corroded the extractor fans so quickly as to make the operation of the tower financially unfeasible. Furthermore, the hydrogen sulphide, which is heavier than air, on exiting the tower dispersed to the surrounding area causing complaints from residents about the unpleasant odours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/8a6f4212-17a5-4657-ae2d-1cbf9304c1f4" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This Adventure Lab takes you a brief walk around Highgate and its surrounding suburbs, to some of the unique historical sights that I am lucky enough to pass on my daily lunch break. There are some incredible homes and buildings in the area with varying architectural styles, which create such a unique suburb with incredible character.

As you answer each question at each stage of the Adventure Lab, make sure that you note the clues to locate the bonus final cache.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Jeena middar (corroborees) are songs and dances that record the katijin, moort and boodjar of Aboriginal people. They were often held when families gathered together. 

In March 1833 two Minang Noongar people from Albany visited, a jeena middar was held to welcome them to Wadjuk boodjar. 

The Wadjuk Noongar prepared for the jeena middar by painting themselves with ritual patterns. The Wadjuk Noongars sang a kangaroo hunting song, led by Wadjuk Noongar boordiya (leader) Yagan the “master of ceremonies”

Buildings now stand on the ground that was once used for jeena middar, you will need to locate the building at the given coordinates.

Once you answer the question an older photo will pop up.
It was hard to cull my list, but I hope you enjoy wandering around the area...

30 minutes should be enough time for this walk...&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

The Church demonstrates the cultural diversity of the community and provides a special place for the Serbian community, who constructed the place and use it as a place of worship and a focus of their society.

The Church was constructed in 1954 by the Serbian community, most of whom had fled Yugoslavia following World War II. It was named after Saint Sava, the first Bishop of Serbia and founder of the Serbian Orthodox Church. He is the most important saint in the Serbian Orthodox Church and the patron saint of education and medicine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/8a6f4212-17a5-4657-ae2d-1cbf9304c1f4" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This Adventure Lab takes you a brief walk around Highgate and its surrounding suburbs, to some of the unique historical sights that I am lucky enough to pass on my daily lunch break. There are some incredible homes and buildings in the area with varying architectural styles, which create such a unique suburb with incredible character.

As you answer each question at each stage of the Adventure Lab, make sure that you note the clues to locate the bonus final cache.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Construction of the square began in February 2016, and it was opened on 3 March 2018.

Designed to acknowledge the significance to the indigenous people, the Noongar people of Perth, the land it is built on as well as the lakes that used to exist under what is now the Perth railway station and Wellington Street.

On the south-western corner of Yagan Square is a 45-metre-high "digital tower", with a wrap-around display screen 30 metres in diameter and 14 metres high with fourteen tall columns rising. 

The design of the Digital Tower, with its distinctive tall columns, is inspired by the bulrushes once found around the area up until the early 1800s. 

You will need to locate the plaque near the digital tower.

This area, near the lowest and easiest crossing point on the Swan River (at Matagarup), was an important communication and trade centre between the coast and the islands. Whadjuck/Balardong custodian Tom Bennell referred to Perth as ”Beerit” meaning ”pathways” due to its importance for meetings, travel and trade.

This Adventure Lab Cache will take you on an approximate 12km journey around Wadjuk Boodjar  depending on the route you take, you may walk, ride, drive (parts) or use public transport to get around, we recommend you give yourself a good half of a day to complete the adventure.

About the artwork – This work is an installation of five forms tethered to the bed of the lake at Eco Park. Inspiration for the forms was from seeds collected in the park, drawing attention to the natural forms within the environment. The artwork makes comment on the passing seasons through the changes in the water levels and climatic changes such as wind and rain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/009228da-dd98-499b-b237-79ef71361934" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Harvest Lakes is a small subdivision in the south of Atwell, but there are heaps of sculptures.

The largest of three dedicated performance areas is the 575 seat Heath Ledger Theatre, named in honour of the late Academy Award winning actor. After an international design competition in 2005, attracting more than 40 designs worldwide, was won by Kerry Hill Architects, construction on the Theatre Centre began in late 2007. In July 2008 the Western Australian government announced that the complex would be named after Heath Ledger, however after a change of government, that decision was modified in December 2008 to apply only to the main auditorium. The centre was officially opened on 27 January 2011.

The coordinates will take you to a laneway running from the Perth Cultural Centre, past the Courtyard  to the Theatre Foyer (NB: access A/H is only via the Cultural Centre). Along the wall of the laneway is a stainless steel art installation called “Interval” by  Arif Satar and Audrey Fernandes-Satar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/3ac167c3-0dba-4363-bb05-0e8eac02c57a" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Since the time of Settlement, the Perth CBD has been home to a vibrant theatre scene and this short Adventure Lab will take you to some of this city’s key live performance locations, both historical and current. The seven locations are in close proximity and you should easily be able to complete the series within two hours. Take your time to appreciate some of the wonderful architecture of the contemporary theatres as well as the remnants of those lost to development. 

Given the building density within this area, the listed coordinates may not be as accurate as desired. However there should be sufficient information in each location’s description for you to find what you need once you have navigated to the general area. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

The land was then sold to a subsequent passive investor before Mary Ann Tapper purchased the land. Mary along with her son Daniel and wife Rosina 
starting out as market gardeners, Daniel eventually included dairy cows in order to supplement the families living. Eventually the site of their homestead became the center of the local community with a petrol pump, telephone exchange and post office. Tappers remained on this property until 1965 when it went into government ownership. The site you are now standing on is the location of the Tapper homestead, which included three houses, that of Mary-Ann, her son Daniel, and her daughter, Florence Korten, &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/ceffc579-0079-4b5f-a7e7-f423f8052655" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Bibra Lake.
Bibra Lake is fourth lake (going north to south) of a string of lakes which combined comprise the Beeliar Regional Park. Bibra Lake has many environmental, heritage and recreational values. Bibra Lake was first known as "Walliabup" but was later named "Bibra" after Benedict von Bibra who brought land in the area in 1843. 
Bibra lake has an interesting history of supporting a dairy farm, post office ,orchard and market garden. It was also home to a battery attached to the 66 Searchlight stationed here in World War 2 along with the regimental headquarters of the 116 Light Anti-Aircraft. This was the base for many women who served in the Australian Women's Army Service.
Today Bibra Lake offers many recreational activities whilst also providing a conservation reserve for our birds and wildlife. This Adventure Lab will take you on a tour of the area and can be completed by walking, riding or by taking the car but to really enjoy the area we recommend making use of the bike path.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

At the time the theatre was opened, it was the largest theatre in Australia, and had seating for over 2,500 people. It is also thought to be the first reinforced concrete building constructed in Perth.

Over its life, the theatre has hosted large-scale musicals, ballet, opera, Shakespearean plays and many other events. It has been renovated numerous times, most notably in the late 1970s when the State Government purchased it and performed an ornamental restoration whilst modernising the facilities provided. Since that time, it has been the home of the West Australian Ballet and West Australian Opera companies, both of which perform regularly.  The theatre is heritage listed and believed to be the only remaining working Edwardian theatre in Australia.

The listed coordinates will take you to the rear of the theatre where you’ll find a plaque marking the original stage door.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/3ac167c3-0dba-4363-bb05-0e8eac02c57a" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

Victoria Institute and Industrial School for the Blind. The Institute originally consisted of a complex of buildings including a factory, workshops and residential facilities. 

In 1932, the building was renamed the West Australian Institute and Industrial School for the Blind, and in 1937 the Lotteries Commission and the government funded the development of the “L-shaped” building, and combined the three previous buildings together.

The resultant 1937 building is a fine example of the Inter-War Stripped Classical Style, and is one the few examples of a prominent Western Australian institution that features strong art deco detailing. 

The refurbished building is now home to the West Australian Ballet Centre.

At the coords, you will find a State Register of Heritage Places plaque.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/939f9691-68c6-4270-9e7c-e4f5b846c975" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Maylands Peninsula is on the northern bank of the Swan River about 5 kilometres east of Perth's city centre, and has a rich and varied history. This Adventure Lab will take you to just a few of the interesting historical buildings and locations in the area. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

The three-storey hotel with its distinctive verandahs was deliberately located to capitalise on the ever-increasing trade coming through Perth Railway Station. After the Fremantle to Guildford line had been completed in 1881, activity moved away from the Swan River and into town next to the station.

Once you answer the question an older photo will pop up.
It was hard to cull my list, but I hope you enjoy wandering around the area...

30 minutes should be enough time for this walk...&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

This adventure lab is best done by bike. 

Since the final physical cache is hidden west of all the virtual locations, the order has been fixed to east to west. In addition, this will allow for those travelling by car to park since all parking is on the river side of Mounts Bay Road.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

The 150th anniversary of the establishment of the Anglican Diocese of Perth and the pioneering work of Bishop Hale was celebrated in 2007.
His areas of interest were the welfare of the indigenous population, the humane treatment of the convicts and the provision of secondary education for the boys of the developing colony.

On 28 June 1858 he opened "The Bishops School" in St Georges Terrace.  The school moved to several sites and since 1961 has been located in Wembley Downs where it proudly bears the title, Hale School.

The coordinates will take you to a fairly well known sculpture created by artist Greg James on behalf of the Old Haleians' Association.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/c9e4a474-ff9e-4510-a2cb-0ea70769e8a1" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1989 the Western Australian state government established a "Percent for Art" policy. The scheme, administered by the Department of Culture and the Arts, requires that up to one percent of the construction budget for new public works over $2,000,000, be expended on public artwork.

Over 700 works have been installed under the state government scheme since 1989.

This tour will take you to only 10 scattered around the Perth CBD.  All should be easy to locate along with the necessary information to complete each of the sites.

Good luck&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

It comprises the Cenotaph, Court of Contemplation, Flame of Remembrance and Pool of Reflection. 

The Cenotaph is an 18 metre granite obelisk honouring all Western Australians who gave their lives in the service of their country.

The Court of Contemplation is located at the western side of the precinct and commemorates the conflicts in which Western Australians have fallen, with the walls featuring the names of major battlefields.

The Flame of Remembrance within the Pool of Reflection burns continuously, symbolising the promise of all Western Australians.

"We will remember them"

Spread over 990 acres, the park is a mixture of grassed parkland, botanical gardens and natural bushland on Mount Eliza. Two-thirds of the grounds are conserved as native bushland. 
Previously known as Perth Park, it officially opened in 1895.  Its name was changed to King's Park in 1901 (dropping the apostrophe in later years).  


This adventure lab cache will highlight some of the special places that Kings Park is famous for.  We hope you enjoy visiting the locations chosen.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

The 24 trees are 110+ years old with a diameter of 0.9m and stand 24m high. 
Significance: the trees are in excellent condition for the species and contribut strongly to the streetscape of Mounts Bay Road where they edge the curved road and contrast strongly with the open riverside of the road. 
History: it has been estimated the trees were planted around 1910.
The trees shade an unpaved carpark with a natural spring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/c378ab2c-ff17-4c4b-b2ae-c27b615e8f45" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The National Trusts of Australia are community based, non government organisations, committed to promoting and conserving Australia’s indigenous, natural and historic heritage places and objects. The National Trusts of Australia are collaborating to create a national register of significant trees, which is consistent with their mission to protect and celebrate Australia’s heritage. There are over 2,500 significant tree records compiled over thirty years across Australia. 
This adventure lab focuses on five trees 100+ years of age. 
Jarrah Tree - Armadale: Historic value; at 1500+ years, this tree reflects the great age of the species and is a significant remnant of the period prior to European colonisation.
Scientific value; the girth and age of this Eucalyptus margin at a makes it valuable as a benchmark site with potential to contribute to future research. Unfortunately it has been significantly impacted by development and vandalism.

About the artwork – This interactive sculpture was inspired by the reeds and sedges that grow naturally in the nearby lake. Working on the principal that the reeds and sedges filter nutrients in the lake, interleaf filters light through the interwoven steel pipes that is then filtered through the artwork to present an ever-changing pattern of shadows in and around the work. The shadows reflect the ever-changing elements of nature and the ongoing changes in the development of the land from bushland to rural to urban.

Being attacked from three fronts the Australian line held for four days before the overwhelming numbers eventually forced a retreat to Eroa Creek, however the battle halted the Japanese advance and the casualties sustained were contributing factors in their advancement south to Port Moresby being unsuccessful.

The Kokoda Trail was a path that linked Ower's Corner, approximately 40 km north-east of Port Moresby, and the small village of Wairopi, on the northern side of the Owen Stanley mountain range. Its name was derived from the village of Kokoda that stood on the northern side of the main range and was the site of the only airfield between Port Moresby and the north coast.

"Kokoda Trail" and "Kokoda Track" have been used interchangeably since the Second World War and the former was adopted by the Battles Nomenclature Committee as the official British Commonwealth battle honour in October 1957.

This memorial walk was opened in 2001 and rises 62m along 150 steps.

Born 22 September 1849, the fourth son of William Forrest and Margaret Guthrie, he worked at his father’s mill until 1868 when he advertised himself as a surveyor. In 1870, he served as second-in-command for his first transcontinental expedition along the edge of the great Australian Bight. On 1 January 1871 he was appointed as surveyor-in-charge of the Albany district and later became an independent licensed surveyor working by contract.  Alexander married Amy Eliza Barrett Lennard on 15 January 1880. Their first born was daughter Sylvia, then four sons, Kimberley, Anthony, John and William. Alexander held the office of Mayor of Perth for six years (1892-95) and was unopposed for a second term 1897-1900. Alexander Forrest died 20 June 1901  aged 51 years old. He had accomplished a great deal including the provision of parks, reserves, tram ways, roads and footpaths and as such had modernized the City of Perth during his lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/e7d9b778-67c6-4a21-a9fb-ddb8b59f71d1" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The city of Perth has its origins in 1829 when the Swan River Colony was established by the British Government. The first colonial Governor, Capt James Stirling, named the new settlement after the Scottish birthplace and parliamentary constituency of the then British Secretary of State for the Colonies, Sir George Murray. When surveying the area previously, Captain Stirling was said to have been stunned by the beauty of the Swan River and the fertile land around it.

Since water transport was vital to communications in the new colony before roads were built, the meanderings of the Swan River determined the site of the first towns. Governor Stirling decided that the site for the colony’s capital would be sited on the river 18km from the sea port of Fremantle. On 12 August 1829 Mrs Helen Dance, wife of the commander of HMS Sulphur, drove an axe into a tree to mark the colony’s foundation.

The city site was mid-way between the sea and the farming areas of the Upper Swan.

The Perth tramway network served Perth, from 1899 until 1958. 

The network was initially run by a private company but was taken over by the state government in 1913. From a single line along Hay Street, the network expanded north as far as Osborne Park, east as far as Welshpool, south as far as Como, and west as far as Claremont. The tramways were gradually replaced by buses after World War II.

Once you answer the question an older photo will pop up.
It was hard to cull my list, but I hope you enjoy wandering around the area...

30 minutes should be enough time for this walk...&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Japanese forces captured the crossing on September 3rd. Australian forces fighting in retreat established a strong defensive position at Brigade Hill. 

From this elevated position the Australian's were able to engage the Japanese from the South and West starting on October 12th and after 4 days of fighting dislodge the enemy.

The Kokoda Trail was a path that linked Ower's Corner, approximately 40 km north-east of Port Moresby, and the small village of Wairopi, on the northern side of the Owen Stanley mountain range. Its name was derived from the village of Kokoda that stood on the northern side of the main range and was the site of the only airfield between Port Moresby and the north coast.

"Kokoda Trail" and "Kokoda Track" have been used interchangeably since the Second World War and the former was adopted by the Battles Nomenclature Committee as the official British Commonwealth battle honour in October 1957.

This memorial walk was opened in 2001 and rises 62m along 150 steps.

About the artwork – Elemental Harvest explores the importance of water to sustainability. The stylised eucalyptus leaves rise from the water like germinating seeds drawing attention to the new life made possible by water. Locating the work in the water allows us to watch the rise and fall of the water levels and the interaction this has on the artwork as some pieces are submerged in the wetter months and then remerge in summer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/009228da-dd98-499b-b237-79ef71361934" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Harvest Lakes is a small subdivision in the south of Atwell, but there are heaps of sculptures. Take the tour to see the sculptures around the lakes and wetlands.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

The circa 1906 hotel building was originally built and owned by Wilhelm Friederich Gustave Liebe. 

Mr Liebe was a well known Perth building contractor whose other prominent projects include His Majesty’s Theatre and the Public Art Gallery. The building is a rare example of a richly detailed Edwardian Hotel in metropolitan Perth.

The local community and the National Trust were successful in their efforts to prevent the demolition of the building in the 1970’s, making it one of the earliest historic places in Western Australia to be saved through public outcry. The National Trust classified the building in 1974.

Today, the building is beautifully restored and is home to Dome Coffees Australia, who in 2013 won an award for their outstanding contribution to heritage at the Western Australian Heritage Awards.

This Adventure Lab will take you to just a few of the interesting historical buildings and locations in the area. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

The sedges, samphires and trees around this area are essential for maintaining the health of the estuary and the waterbirds.The seagrass meadows provide a nursery habitat for fish and crustaceans. Dead and decaying seagrass provides food for invertebrates that are food for waterbirds. The shallow mudflats are exposed during low tide which may only be for a few hours each day. These mudflats hide mussel deposits and are home to worms, aquatic snails, insects and other minute crustaceans sought after by waterbirds.Other waterbirds trap small fish in the open water.
This adventure is best done on a lovely bike ride which will give you beautiful views of the Swan River and the many waterbirds. See how many different species you can count!&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Of the 1100 Australian troops of the 2/16th (Western Australia) and 2/14th (Victoria) battalions only 143 remained.
Being close to the main stores allowed for fresh troops and supplies to reinforce the Australian lines.

The Japanese force heavily depleted of supplies and troops were ordered to abandon their position and retreat to the north coast where two months earlier they had started their advance.

Australian forces pursued closely and there was limited resistance before Templeton's Crossing.

The Kokoda Trail was a path that linked Ower's Corner, approximately 40 km north-east of Port Moresby, and the small village of Wairopi, on the northern side of the Owen Stanley mountain range. Its name was derived from the village of Kokoda that stood on the northern side of the main range and was the site of the only airfield between Port Moresby and the north coast.

"Kokoda Trail" and "Kokoda Track" have been used interchangeably since the Second World War and the former was adopted by the Battles Nomenclature Committee as the official British Commonwealth battle honour in October 1957.

This memorial walk was opened in 2001 and rises 62m along 150 steps.

At this particular location there is a bench seat shaded by a cluster of very large trees.

This adventure lab is best done by bike. 

Since the final physical cache is hidden west of all the virtual locations, the order has been fixed to east to west. In addition, this will allow for those travelling by car to park since all parking is on the river side of Mounts Bay Road.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Opening in 2004, it provides regular laughs to the people of Perth, and features interstate and international comedy talent alongside local comedians.

The coordinates will take you to the footpath side of the entrance gate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/3ac167c3-0dba-4363-bb05-0e8eac02c57a" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Since the time of Settlement, the Perth CBD has been home to a vibrant theatre scene and this short Adventure Lab will take you to some of this city’s key live performance locations, both historical and current. The seven locations are in close proximity and you should easily be able to complete the series within two hours. Take your time to appreciate some of the wonderful architecture of the contemporary theatres as well as the remnants of those lost to development. 

Given the building density within this area, the listed coordinates may not be as accurate as desired. However there should be sufficient information in each location’s description for you to find what you need once you have navigated to the general area. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

The statue was unveiled on the 29th September 2011 on the occasion of Sir Charles Court's 100th birthday. The statue is symbolically located on St Georges Terrace near Parliament House and the Woodside Building to highlight Sir Charles' role in the development of the North-West Shelf and Western Australia.

Sir Charles Court served as a Member of the WA Parliament for 29 years from 1974 until 1982 and is famed for his hand in WA's mining boom. Sir Charles was a strong advocate for WA and a man who defended the right of the State to manage its own affairs.

Sir Charles was also known for his divisive decisions including the close of the Perth-Fremantle railway service and his role in the Noonkanbah land-rights dispute which led to a low point between indigenous and government relations. Sir Charles Court died in 2007. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/c9e4a474-ff9e-4510-a2cb-0ea70769e8a1" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1989 the Western Australian state government established a "Percent for Art" policy. The scheme, administered by the Department of Culture and the Arts, requires that up to one percent of the construction budget for new public works over $2,000,000, be expended on public artwork.

Over 700 works have been installed under the state government scheme since 1989.

This tour will take you to only 10 scattered around the Perth CBD.  All should be easy to locate along with the necessary information to complete each of the sites.

Good luck&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Teams must choose which task they believe best suits their skills.

Here you have a choice between Count &amp; Calculate.

Count: Head to the Kaarta Gar-up Lookout (S31 57.549 E115 50.659) and count the number of vertical poles along the lookouts fencing. Enter this number to unlock the next lab location.

Calculate: Head to the Wishing Well (S31 57.577 E115 50.654) and calculate the following L3W3 Word Value + Teeth on Gear = A
A x Spokes in Gear = B
B - L4W5 Word Value = Answer, enter this number to unlock the next lab location.


Once the teams arrived in Perth they made their way to Kings Park where a clue box was waiting for them to give them information about where to head to next. 
During the filming of the episode the clue box was set up between the State War Memorial and Eternal Flame. A slight adjustment for your race today will bring you to one of the best views of Perth City the park has to offer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/59ba51eb-26ca-4ea3-b29a-9d8f9fb679a9" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Amazing Race is a reality television program that started in the US in 2001.

It sees teams race against each other around the world, completing challenges along the way to get the next piece of information needed to continue on the race.

The first season of The Amazing Race Australia was in 2011. It saw 11 teams race around the world going to 10 countries and covering over 50 000km. The series culminated in the final three teams racing around Perth completing challenges attempting to arrive at the check-in point first and claim a $250 000 prize.

In this recreation of the final leg you will have to make your way along the same route that the teams did to claim your final prize, not cash but a cache (GC9G7E2).&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Officially opening in 1965, it is an 18 hectare site within the Kings Park displaying a collection of around 3000 species of Western Australian flora.

The lookout offers spectacular views of the Perth Waterways and Darling Scarp and can be enjoyed whilst also visiting the Boab Tree, Pioneer Women’s Memorial and the Federation Walkway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/c4b5e2d1-4e09-477b-b926-93ab6865c238" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kings Park is one of the most popular visitor destinations in Western Australia, with spectacular views of the Perth Waterways and Darling Range. Spread over 990 acres, the park is a mixture of grassed parkland, botanical gardens and natural bushland on Mount Eliza. Two-thirds of the grounds are conserved as native bushland. 
Previously known as Perth Park, it officially opened in 1895.  Its name was changed to King's Park in 1901 (dropping the apostrophe in later years).  


This adventure lab cache will highlight some of the special places that Kings Park is famous for.  We hope you enjoy visiting the locations chosen.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

These men drove the camel teams, which carried supplies from Perth to the Goldfields and were vital to the survival of the mining communities in the early days of the boom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/057569b0-a820-4f10-b853-2d1380813011" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This series takes you around some of the important historical sites in the colonial settlement of Perth. 

From the early market gardens tended by Chinese migrants to locations that became important in the gold rush of the 1890's. 

The five locations are an easy 1.6 km walk that can be completed in about half an hour but give yourself time to enjoy the area’s attractions.

Once La Tavernetta Winehouse and Restaurant, the building changed hands many times over the years. Currently, it is known as An Sibin with Air and Mint nightclubs upstairs. 

If you look carefully on the Lake Street side of the building (referencing the old photo that will pop up after your answer the question)- the top round windows at the back are a tell-tale sign of the original building, including the brick feature wall at the front.

Once you answer the question an older photo will pop up.
It was hard to cull my list, but I hope you enjoy wandering around the area...

30 minutes should be enough time for this walk...&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

The designs originally stem from painted ceremonial markings found in historical photographs and have been reinterpreted by Rod Garlett in extensive consultation with elders in the local Aboriginal community.

The scheme, administered by the Department of Culture and the Arts, requires that up to one percent of the construction budget for new public works over $2,000,000, be expended on public artwork.

Over 700 works have been installed under the state government scheme since 1989.

This tour will take you to only 10 scattered around the Perth CBD.  All should be easy to locate along with the necessary information to complete each of the sites.

Good luck&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

It offers spectacular views and is where the Place of Reflection can also be found.

A tranquil and shady setting, it features the Roe memorial which bears a bronze plate depicting one of the earliest maps of Perth. Built in 1956 and constructed of hewn granite in hexagonal form, it was named after John Septimus Roe, who was responsible for surveying and apportioning the land in Perth.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/c4b5e2d1-4e09-477b-b926-93ab6865c238" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kings Park is one of the most popular visitor destinations in Western Australia, with spectacular views of the Perth Waterways and Darling Range. Spread over 990 acres, the park is a mixture of grassed parkland, botanical gardens and natural bushland on Mount Eliza. Two-thirds of the grounds are conserved as native bushland. 
Previously known as Perth Park, it officially opened in 1895.  Its name was changed to King's Park in 1901 (dropping the apostrophe in later years).  


This adventure lab cache will highlight some of the special places that Kings Park is famous for.  We hope you enjoy visiting the locations chosen.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

The series follows the CircleRoute bus service, one of Perth's high frequency family of bus services. The CircleRoute bus service operates with up to 1228 weekly services.

There are 5 lab locations, one at each station where the CircleRoute crosses a train line. A bonus final cache is located in Fremantle, the start and end point of the CircleRoute.

Make sure you also pick up the 17 traditional caches located at each timing point along the CircleRoute. &lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Not far behind you is the Mt Eliza Reservoir is where the water is stored.

Right next to the fountain is the Tea Rooms Shelter. In 1899 the Terrace Tearooms was officially opened but down on the Swan River at Terrace Gardens. But in 1919 the Tea Room was moved to this location as a public Shelter, and there was 3 of these buildings in Kings Park - this is the last remaining.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/e1fa713b-0775-4ace-ad00-6eff90846441" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Welcome to King Park, Fraser Ave has a few lesser known monuments and statues of WA’s history.

"The camera does not obscure
Only with hindsight can the future be lucidly inhabited; present
reality was once prophetic imagination.
Each site, each place is seen through all senses.
The impartial lens commits structure to the archives, but recognise
the power of sensitivity to reveal essential memory."

The scheme, administered by the Department of Culture and the Arts, requires that up to one percent of the construction budget for new public works over $2,000,000, be expended on public artwork.

Over 700 works have been installed under the state government scheme since 1989.

This tour will take you to only 10 scattered around the Perth CBD.  All should be easy to locate along with the necessary information to complete each of the sites.

These were the guards who came to Australia on convict ships that transported nearly 10,000 prisoners to Western Australia from 1850.

Originally based in Fremantle, most convict work later moved to Perth. This created a need for accommodation in Perth for the Pensioner Guards and their families. Architect Richard Roach Jewell was appointed to design an appropriate building. 

Today the Arch is one of Perth’s most iconic historic buildings, located at the top of St George’s Terrace, next to the Mitchell Freeway and in front of Parliament House. It not only represents Perth’s convict era, but shows how Western Australia slowly came to feel a need to protect its heritage buildings.

Find the sculpture in front of the arch.  There are some metal plates between the two hands.  You are interested only in the plate in the sculptures right hand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/7ba2105b-269b-4f75-9d77-8a158e9cdf1e" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Take a trip visiting the early European history of the Western Australia colony.

Indigenous Australians have been occupying Western Australia for around 40,000 to 60,000 years.

The first recorded European contact was in 1616 when Dutch explorer Dirk Hartog landed on the west coast but the first permanent settlement was not made until 1826 when a settlement was established at Albany to formally take possession of the western third of the continent of Australia for the British Crown.  The Swan River Colony was established in 1829 starting the official history of European settlement of Western Australia.

This set of lab caches explores the early buildings and places of the Swan River Colony.

From stop 14, walk through the QV1 Plaza and up St georges tce.

Built in 1866 Barracks Arch was originally the entrance to a large building called the Pensioner Barracks.
The Barracks were gradually converted to offices for the Public Works Department between 1900 and 1904, becoming its headquarters in 1904. 
Notable occupants included C. Y. O'Connor, whose office was immediately above the arch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/2b086e18-1940-4fa8-ae54-650e6f68b64d" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This adventure takes you on a tour in the Perth CBD.

This tour takes advantage of the free to ride Red Cat Bus route, there are historic buildings, side tours, museums and parkland to checkout along the way.

If you are driving to the CBD, the adventure can be completed in any order, so just park up and hop on the bus anywhere along the route.
However I recommend catching the train into Perth CBD and commencing the adventure at the Red Cat Bus stop 24 - Wellington St Perth Station. From this stop the first location is St Mary's Cathedral.

Spread over 990 acres, the park is a mixture of grassed parkland, botanical gardens and natural bushland on Mount Eliza. Two-thirds of the grounds are conserved as native bushland. 
Previously known as Perth Park, it officially opened in 1895.  Its name was changed to King's Park in 1901 (dropping the apostrophe in later years).

Elford. For a period from at least 1915 to 1920 it was run by William W. Sloan and in 1929 there was a Mr H.P Best a grocer and wine &amp; spirit merchant. It is quite probable that one of these businesses held the liquor licence which was the precusor to current establishments.

Clarke's Building was erected on a site which was originally part of the Highgate Hill subdivision, which initially took place in the 1870's and was one of the first subdivisions of Perth. It was constructed in 1934 as a modern art deco commercial and retail premise. The construction of such a building at this time, in the middle of the Depression, must be considered unusual. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/ca7bc399-a1c4-4373-a312-535d71835830" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This Adventure Lab will take you on a brief tour of the Mount Lawley's Beaufort Street Commercial Precinct and a surrounding landmark about one block away. The area features prominent art deco architectural style buildings throughout the neighbourhood that represent the Interwar period.

This adventure lab is best done by bike. 

Since the final physical cache is hidden west of all the virtual locations, the order has been fixed to east to west. In addition, this will allow for those travelling by car to park since all parking is on the river side of Mounts Bay Road.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

The obliqueness of the corner enables the south and west elevations to be viewed as a whole, emphasising the curved massing of the upper level of the façade, and contrasting glazed shop fronts at ground level. The red colour and texture of the brickwork, in contrast to the light rendered relief detailing and expanses of glass, also contributes towards its simple, aesthetic appeal.

The Beaucott Buildings as refurbished, were designed by the well known Perth architect W. G. Bennett, who was a leading exponent of the Inter War Functionalist and Art Deco styles in Western Australia at this period. It was first at the Beaufort/Walcott St intersection to be refurbished in the Inter War Functionalist style, establishing the character of the precinct.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/ca7bc399-a1c4-4373-a312-535d71835830" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This Adventure Lab will take you on a brief tour of the Mount Lawley's Beaufort Street Commercial Precinct and a surrounding landmark about one block away.

They are a landmark at the important intersection of Walcott and Beaufort Streets. Simon Alexander was responsible for the design and construction of the Broadway Building and his son was responsible for its adaptation into the Alexander Buildings. The history, form, style and landmark qualities of the Alexander Buildings complement the Lyceum Buildings opposite, now the Astor Theatre, also designed, developed and adapted by Simon and John Alexander. These landmark buildings have long been considered the heart of the Mt Lawley town centre.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/ca7bc399-a1c4-4373-a312-535d71835830" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This Adventure Lab will take you on a brief tour of the Mount Lawley's Beaufort Street Commercial Precinct and a surrounding landmark about one block away.

Astor Theatre is closely associated with the Alexander family who were involved in the original construction of the building and its remodelling. It is also closely associated with architect William Leighton, who designed many of Western Australia's cinemas during the 1930s. While the authenticity of the original 1914 building is low, the authenticity of the remodelled Art Deco 1939 building is high as the main rooms - the auditorium, lobbies and stairs - are close to the original state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/ca7bc399-a1c4-4373-a312-535d71835830" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This Adventure Lab will take you on a brief tour of the Mount Lawley's Beaufort Street Commercial Precinct and a surrounding landmark about one block away.

The Hotel was built around 1897-1898 at the time of the early Gold Boom and originally known as the Royal Standard Hotel, which was an important local landmark. 

On this corner there are clues to the types of businesses that existed in the building on this side of the road, (197 - 205 Brisbane street). These can be seen on the mosaic murals on the pillars - such as a Chemist, Butcher, Barber, Fruiterer and Grocer.

From the early market gardens tended by Chinese migrants to locations that became important in the gold rush of the 1890's. 

The five locations are an easy 1.6 km walk that can be completed in about half an hour but give yourself time to enjoy the area’s attractions.

The sedges, samphires and trees around this area are essential for maintaining the health of the estuary and the waterbirds.The seagrass meadows provide a nursery habitat for fish and crustaceans. Dead and decaying seagrass provides food for invertebrates that are food for waterbirds. The shallow mudflats are exposed during low tide which may only be for a few hours each day. These mudflats hide mussel deposits and are home to worms, aquatic snails, insects and other minute crustaceans sought after by waterbirds.Other waterbirds trap small fish in the open water.
This adventure is best done on a lovely bike ride which will give you beautiful views of the Swan River and the many waterbirds. See how many different species you can count!&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

These are ordinary people, who stood up to be counted in extraordinary times and made the ultimate sacrifice.
This series is a roughly 10 km in length and encompasses a small number of memorials, large and small, old and new that were commissioned either by the people of the community in the area or the local branch of the R.S.L.  &lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

The first stage of Parliament House was completed in 1904. The eastern wing was constructed between 1958 and 1964. The staged construction of the building reflects two architectural styles - the Federation style of the early 1900s and more classical lines and columns of the 1960s.

The grounds of Parliament house has evolved with changes to the City and Parliament house building works. In recent times many native plants from all over the state have been incorporated.

Parliament House has a self-guided tour of the external architectural features of the building, and the Parliament House gardens and formal tours are available Mondays 10.30 am Thursdays 10.30 am and Fridays 2.00 pm. Except public holidays.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/2b086e18-1940-4fa8-ae54-650e6f68b64d" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This adventure takes you on a tour in the Perth CBD.

This tour takes advantage of the free to ride Red Cat Bus route, there are historic buildings, side tours, museums and parkland to checkout along the way.

If you are driving to the CBD, the adventure can be completed in any order, so just park up and hop on the bus anywhere along the route.
However I recommend catching the train into Perth CBD and commencing the adventure at the Red Cat Bus stop 24 - Wellington St Perth Station. From this stop the first location is St Mary's Cathedral.

It is a dedicated nature space that encourages learning and discovery and gives city kids the opportunity to have a ‘bush experience’ in the heart of Perth. The  aim is to give children a hands-on experience of WA’s natural environment that will inspire them to play an active role in environmental conservation throughout their lives. The park is surrounded by natural bushland and features large aerial walkways called The Python and The Bungarra, a creek and waterhole for wading in, a cubby-building area, tunnels, rocks and a web of climbing ropes called The Tangle.
It covers six hectares and can be explored on accessible paths, bridges and boardwalks. 
Please plan your visit; it has open and close hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/20f44e6d-6c71-4002-8a92-d0d8a3839ae2" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This one is for the kids! We packed a picnic and spent the day exploring the playgrounds. Alternatively, two of the locations have cafe's. 

Kings Park is one of the world’s largest and most beautiful inner city parks. It is rich in Aboriginal and European history, contemporary culture and offers innovative design, displays and services. Kings Park has an international reputation for scientific research, leading horticulture, conservation and public education.
Kings Park is home to the spectacular Western Australian Botanic Garden, which displays over 3,000 species of the State’s unique flora. Two thirds of the 400 hectare park is protected as bushland and provides a haven for native biological diversity.
Visitors can enjoy sweeping views of the Swan and Canning Rivers, the city skyline and the Darling Ranges to the east. Bushland walk trails, immaculate gardens and parklands and a variety of children’s discovery play areas can all be found in Kings Park.

Spread over 990 acres, the park is a mixture of grassed parkland, botanical gardens and natural bushland on Mount Eliza. Two-thirds of the grounds are conserved as native bushland. 
Previously known as Perth Park, it officially opened in 1895.  Its name was changed to King's Park in 1901 (dropping the apostrophe in later years).

In 1997 a "Workers Embassy" was set up on some vacant land opposite the Parliament House during union protests of the Court Government's "third wave" legislation for industrial relations. What began with a caravan and portable barbecue soon transformed into a landscaped shelter with a monument to the trade union workers who have died during their work.

At this waypoint, you will find a memorial to Mark F. Allen, Trade Union Organiser for the BLF/CFMEU who lost his life in 1996 trying to protect the safety of workers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/9a06c184-2795-46b2-9e9c-7d7307bfab89" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This Adventure Lab will take you to some key locations within the Parliamentary Precinct.

Constructed in the Post-War International style, it was built by the State Government and has been occupied by various Government departments since opening. In 1978, Government Building was named Dumas House in honour of Sir Russell Dumas (1887-1975), former Public Works Department Director of Works and Buildings.

After 50 years the building was showing signs of deterioration and from 2014 a four year process commenced to remediate the deterioration and to conserve the building. In the 2019 Architecture Awards, the project was awarded a commendation for conservation of a significant 20th century heritage building.

At this waypoint, you will find a plaque mounted on a pedestal.

The site had always been considered small from the beginning, and with student numbers continuing to grow, a location for a new and large school complex was secured in Wembley Downs in 1938. However due to the outbreak of WW2, work on the new site was delayed. Hale School remained at West Perth until 1958 when the new school was finally completed and the students were relocated.

At this waypoint you will find several interpretive signs surrounding Hale House which provide details of the building's history and an insight into boarding house life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/9a06c184-2795-46b2-9e9c-7d7307bfab89" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This Adventure Lab will take you to some key locations within the Parliamentary Precinct.

Its chief roles were keeping Standard Time for Western Australia and meteorological data collection. The observatory dome was demolished in the 1960s to make way for Dumas House, after the Observatory of the city was relocated to Bickley in 1965. The house of the chief astronomer of the old observatory remains today, the current tenant is the National Trust

Several smaller out-buildings housed equipment to measure the weather and the one o'clock gun allowed locals to standardise their clocks.

Light pollution caused the relocation of the telescopes to Bickley in the 1960s.  The site continued to be used as government offices and has been the central offices of the National Trust of Western Australia since 1985.

The building is currently under renovation.  Near the coordinates and behind a construction fence is an entrance sign pointing right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/7ba2105b-269b-4f75-9d77-8a158e9cdf1e" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Take a trip visiting the early European history of the Western Australia colony.

Indigenous Australians have been occupying Western Australia for around 40,000 to 60,000 years.

The first recorded European contact was in 1616 when Dutch explorer Dirk Hartog landed on the west coast but the first permanent settlement was not made until 1826 when a settlement was established at Albany to formally take possession of the western third of the continent of Australia for the British Crown.  The Swan River Colony was established in 1829 starting the official history of European settlement of Western Australia.

This set of lab caches explores the early buildings and places of the Swan River Colony.

These sat behind one of the finest heritage buildings in the area that was demolished during refurbishment of the park in 1965. A paved footprint showing the position of the outer walls confirms that this was the largest residence in the area when it was built in 1885. 

At the time of its construction, it had its own fountain and tennis court. Later it became a private school and then a nursing home before eventually being demolished to open Robertson Park to Palmerston Street. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/057569b0-a820-4f10-b853-2d1380813011" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This series takes you around some of the important historical sites in the colonial settlement of Perth. 

From the early market gardens tended by Chinese migrants to locations that became important in the gold rush of the 1890's. 

The five locations are an easy 1.6 km walk that can be completed in about half an hour but give yourself time to enjoy the area’s attractions.

Later a camping ground was established for the bullock waggoners and men on their way to the Goldfields. 

In 1898 the site was redesigned as a park by Lyall Hall, becoming Hyde Park, which included two lakes with island bird sanctuaries in the middle. 

In subsequent years, shelter sheds, playgrounds, a rotunda, picnic and a barbeque area were all added and it remains a very popular local park.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/057569b0-a820-4f10-b853-2d1380813011" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This series takes you around some of the important historical sites in the colonial settlement of Perth.

Inter-War Functionalist style. The building was designed by architectural firm Powell, Cameron &amp; Chisolm who were responsible for several notable buildings in Western Australia.

In 1998, the City of Stirling began a program to upgrade facilities at the Mount Lawley Bowling Club. The plans for the upgrade, by Bateman, Grundmann Wilson Architects, involved the demolition of the 1957 Function Hall and construction of a new, larger function room, a minor hall, offices, changing rooms, kitchens and stores, all to the east and south of the original Mount Lawley Tennis Club building. The extension was designed to imitate the Inter-war Functionalist architectural style original building and included curvilinear features to the new main entrance on the western elevation, matching finial details, a stepped pediment, and matching render and brickwork. The internal decoration was also designed to imitate the style.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/ca7bc399-a1c4-4373-a312-535d71835830" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This Adventure Lab will take you on a brief tour of the Mount Lawley's Beaufort Street Commercial Precinct and a surrounding landmark about one block away. The area features prominent art deco architectural style buildings throughout the neighbourhood that represent the Interwar period.

As you answer each question at each stage of the Adventure Lab, make sure that you note the clues to locate the bonus final cache, which is located within the Beaufort Street precinct.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

James Fox, an ex-convict, worked the land here and by 1893, when it was sold to John Chipper, several farm buildings had been erected. 

Later, the land was sold to Dr Daniel Kenny who built a four roomed brick and iron cottage in 1903 on the south-western corner. This has become known as Lee Hop’s Cottage, named after one of the Chinese men who lived there and worked on the 18-acre market garden.

These are ordinary people, who stood up to be counted in extraordinary times and made the ultimate sacrifice.
This series is a roughly 10 km in length and encompasses a small number of memorials, large and small, old and new that were commissioned either by the people of the community in the area or the local branch of the R.S.L.  &lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Situated within the precinct is Stickybeaks Cafe and the historic Hale Oval which has been in use since 1897.   The Ivey Watson Playground is also located here and developed especially for children aged six and under.

The co-ordinates will take you to a plaque dedicated to the RAAF 460 Heavy Bomber Squadron.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/c4b5e2d1-4e09-477b-b926-93ab6865c238" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kings Park is one of the most popular visitor destinations in Western Australia, with spectacular views of the Perth Waterways and Darling Range. Spread over 990 acres, the park is a mixture of grassed parkland, botanical gardens and natural bushland on Mount Eliza. Two-thirds of the grounds are conserved as native bushland. 
Previously known as Perth Park, it officially opened in 1895.  Its name was changed to King's Park in 1901 (dropping the apostrophe in later years).

Biara (formerly Stickybeaks) Cafe and Poolgarla Parkland (formerly Hale Oval) provide ideal facilities for families, with older children enjoying ball sports, the popular space net and the 'learn-to-ride' bicycle path.
There are several shelters in the area and fantastic shade trees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/20f44e6d-6c71-4002-8a92-d0d8a3839ae2" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This one is for the kids! We packed a picnic and spent the day exploring the playgrounds. Alternatively, two of the locations have cafe's. 

Kings Park is one of the world’s largest and most beautiful inner city parks. It is rich in Aboriginal and European history, contemporary culture and offers innovative design, displays and services. Kings Park has an international reputation for scientific research, leading horticulture, conservation and public education.
Kings Park is home to the spectacular Western Australian Botanic Garden, which displays over 3,000 species of the State’s unique flora. Two thirds of the 400 hectare park is protected as bushland and provides a haven for native biological diversity.
Visitors can enjoy sweeping views of the Swan and Canning Rivers, the city skyline and the Darling Ranges to the east. Bushland walk trails, immaculate gardens and parklands and a variety of children’s discovery play areas can all be found in Kings Park.

The sedges, samphires and trees around this area are essential for maintaining the health of the estuary and the waterbirds.The seagrass meadows provide a nursery habitat for fish and crustaceans. Dead and decaying seagrass provides food for invertebrates that are food for waterbirds. The shallow mudflats are exposed during low tide which may only be for a few hours each day. These mudflats hide mussel deposits and are home to worms, aquatic snails, insects and other minute crustaceans sought after by waterbirds.Other waterbirds trap small fish in the open water.
This adventure is best done on a lovely bike ride which will give you beautiful views of the Swan River and the many waterbirds. See how many different species you can count!&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

The first Honour Avenue plaques were dedicated to 404 fallen soldiers in August 1919, on the fifth anniversary of the outbreak of World War I. There are currently now around 1800 plaques along the Honour Avenues in Kings Park. 

May Circle is the site of the initial dedication, and where plaques are added to the Honour Avenues.  The most recent dedication service was held in 2019.

With an ‘Evolution Through Time’ theme, kids can follow the footprints of dinosaurs that roamed the Earth millions of years ago, discover the bird species that call this area of the park home and conquer the 75 metre ‘Windy Walk’, high in the treetops.
Explore the Stromatolite Boardwalk to learn about the ‘living rocks’ dotted in the ornamental lake. On the boardwalk you can also learn about the species of birds that call Kings Park home. From ducks, to parrots, to owls; there are more than a dozen species who live here.  
Look up; can you see the ancient lycopod trees, replicas of the world's first trees that existed about 1,200 million years ago?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/20f44e6d-6c71-4002-8a92-d0d8a3839ae2" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This one is for the kids!

It has been given a new lease of life. What was once a much-loved but worn-out playground that had entertained Perth children for more than three decades, has been revamped into an exciting and challenging area for children to explore, discover, play and simply enjoy being outdoors. It features a 75m-long elevated walkway and two-tiered island fort suitable for children over six years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/20f44e6d-6c71-4002-8a92-d0d8a3839ae2" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This one is for the kids! We packed a picnic and spent the day exploring the playgrounds. Alternatively, two of the locations have cafe's. 

Kings Park is one of the world’s largest and most beautiful inner city parks. It is rich in Aboriginal and European history, contemporary culture and offers innovative design, displays and services. Kings Park has an international reputation for scientific research, leading horticulture, conservation and public education.
Kings Park is home to the spectacular Western Australian Botanic Garden, which displays over 3,000 species of the State’s unique flora. Two thirds of the 400 hectare park is protected as bushland and provides a haven for native biological diversity.
Visitors can enjoy sweeping views of the Swan and Canning Rivers, the city skyline and the Darling Ranges to the east. Bushland walk trails, immaculate gardens and parklands and a variety of children’s discovery play areas can all be found in Kings Park.

In 1974, the area became the home of the Ernst Wittwer Playground and was refurbished in 2009 with modern community facilities and an innovative nature based play area.  

The precinct is also home to several memorials honouring those lost in war including the Flame Memorial and the Toobruk Memorial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/c4b5e2d1-4e09-477b-b926-93ab6865c238" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kings Park is one of the most popular visitor destinations in Western Australia, with spectacular views of the Perth Waterways and Darling Range. Spread over 990 acres, the park is a mixture of grassed parkland, botanical gardens and natural bushland on Mount Eliza. Two-thirds of the grounds are conserved as native bushland. 
Previously known as Perth Park, it officially opened in 1895.  Its name was changed to King's Park in 1901 (dropping the apostrophe in later years).

The current owners, the Lawrence family purchased Alfred’s in 1986 and have grown the business over the years to what you see today. With both 30years of ownership and 75years of operation.
They also now have a dining area in a historic 1906 train carriage.

Thanks to Variety - the Children's Charity WA, new picnic and adventure play elements were added in 2014 and include a fort, climbing net, bridges, tunnels and climbing logs, as well as new barbecues and picnic tables. The playground helps children with disabilities to get out and about in the community, to communicate, achieve independence and increase self-esteem.
There are several wood carvings in Variety Place made by local artist Nic Compton. If you look closely you might be able to see grasshoppers, wasps, bugs and beetles.

These are ordinary people, who stood up to be counted in extraordinary times and made the ultimate sacrifice.
This series is a roughly 10 km in length and encompasses a small number of memorials, large and small, old and new that were commissioned either by the people of the community in the area or the local branch of the R.S.L.  &lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

53,000 people attended the opening ceremony at Perry Lake Stadium on a stinking hot 40 degree day.

The games were a huge success, putting Perth on the international map and spurring development of the city.

This adventure lab takes you to four of the sites used for the games. Collect a clue at each site to solve the coordinates for the bonus cache. It is recommended to start at Beatty Park.

The history of the suburb of Guildford had its beginnings in 1827 when Captain James Stirling was despatched by Governor Darling of New South Wales to explore part of the West Coast of Australia. Whilst exploring the Swan River, Stirling was favourably impressed by the fertile alluvial flats around the area now known as Guildford, and replenished his water supplies from Success Spring at Success Hill on the west bank of the Swan River at Bassendean. The junction of the Swan and Helena Rivers was also chosen as the site for a town, and the first surveys were carried out in the Town of Guildford by HC Sutherland in late 1829. The name was chosen after the town of Guildford, in Surrey, England, where James and Ellen were married.  Their property was named “Woodbridge”, which was probably the choice of Ellen Stirling, as she came from 'Woodbridge' in Surrey.

At the coordinates you will find a plaque in the ground within the square of bricks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/02bfc544-156d-4cad-a499-2bcc61ab7736" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the West Oz Geocaching Road Trip adventure taking you to some interesting locations in Western Australia.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

In Colonial times, its strategic importance was as a river port, servicing agricultural expansion in the Colony.  The layout of the town copied English designs of a central village square and an Anglican church.
 In 1841 the Guildford colonial gaol, was largely built by convict labour and is significant as an example of a public building dating from the early decades of colonial settlement in the State. The building has since been renovated  and is now part of a museum. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/bc1cff31-a979-47e8-849a-54b605eddcf8" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the Swan Valley, known for its Viticulture, Breweries and its Tourism.  Follow Captain James Stirling's journey as he made his way along the Swan River in 1827 to settle a colony.  
Along the way there is plenty to see, get your taste buds working and sample some produce from well known establishments along the way.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

The originators of the Perth Medical Centre scheme stipulated amongst other things, 'outlook from the buildings is to be as pleasant as possible; integration with nature is to be sought after at all times'.  It succeeds with that remit in that the views from the 8th floor across Kings Park and over to Matilda Bay are beautiful. It is therefore such a shame the building itself is so ugly!

Across Hospital Avenue from G block you will find a sparkly piece of artwork.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/efa3aa84-d9c9-4abf-88de-3d6b51046d7e" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the Queen Elizabeth II Medical Centre, home to the largest medical centre in the southern hemisphere, hosting globally recognised major medical, research and education tenants.

Back in the 1950s the first hospital to be housed on the site was the Perth Chest Hospital (currently A Block), built to look after mainly tuberculosis patients. In 1963 the expanding hospital became known as Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital after the then current Governor of Western Australia.

Linked to the Swan River via an underground tunnel, alcohol and supplies were delivered direct from boats through the tunnel to the hotel. Whilst history can’t explain the reasons, staff and owners experience unexplained noises. 

Tales of a legless ghost wandering the establishment and a poltergeist playing havoc in the owner’s quarters have spawned.

Perth is no different. 

Tales of ghostly encounters can be found across the city and by partaking on this paranormal hunt you may experience your very own unexplained event.

Your adventure covers approximately 53kms and is available anytime however to fully experience possibilities of the afterlife, it is suggested you wait until darkness falls. A good torch will be needed if venturing out after dark.

Leederville

Leederville is named after William Leeder, the first landowner in the area. He arrived in the colony on the 'Rockingham' in 1830, and in 1833 bought land near Lake Monger. Private subdivision began about 1890 and the expanding district was already known as Leederville in April 1895 when it was declared as a Roads Board District. It was gazetted as a municipality on 3 May 1896.

As his herd grew he supplied milk to Perth and its growing suburbs before he moved his growing business to Bayswater in 1896.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/efa3aa84-d9c9-4abf-88de-3d6b51046d7e" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the Queen Elizabeth II Medical Centre, home to the largest medical centre in the southern hemisphere, hosting globally recognised major medical, research and education tenants.

Back in the 1950s the first hospital to be housed on the site was the Perth Chest Hospital (currently A Block), built to look after mainly tuberculosis patients. In 1963 the expanding hospital became known as Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital after the then current Governor of Western Australia.

The strip is most famous for its cafes. Quite literally, each block has at least one. As is customary for areas with cafe atmosphere, street art abounds. I’ve picked out 5 locations but there are many more to enjoy. A bike lane does run down the length of the strip on both the eastern and western sides; not the best of designs so use at your own peril.

Special thanks to the Applecross Senior High School students who designed  and made the twelve mosaics. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/6c64c838-c2d3-4291-b34f-aa94c24fc812" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Point Walter Reserve was named after the principal feature on the Swan River, Point Walter, which was originally named by Captain James Stirling in 1827 after a favourite uncle.

When the tide is out, you can walk from the foreshore out into the river along the Point Walter Sandbar. Many people take advantage of this natural phenomenon to snap an interesting photo!

Between 1902 and 1904 the Western Australian Government Railway Workshops were relocated to Midland.
The Midland Railway Workshops ran for close to a century on the Eastern fringe of Perth, Western Australia.

Large and multifaceted, the Workshops were vital to the development and maintenance of the West Australian rail system, and a crucial training ground for skilled tradespeople. Their closure in 1994 brought to an end not only a specific industrial complex but also a complex social community.

Despite the harsh, dirty and often dangerous working conditions, many thousands of former workers regretted the loss of the traditions, camaraderie and pride in workmanship that characterised their Midland working lives.

When the tide is out, you can walk from the foreshore out into the river along the Point Walter Sandbar. Many people take advantage of this natural phenomenon to snap an interesting photo!

Land was acquired in 1830 by the first European settlers Lionel Lukin and Alfred Waylen.  Waylen built a villa at Point Walter in 1830, and acquired a further 700 acres in 1831 extending his grant from  Point Walter as far east along the Swan River frontage to Alfred Cove. Popular  access  by  the  community saw  the  area  used  for  camping, swimming, picnicking and crabbing.   A  jetty was subsequently constructed since access  was  solely by water; ferries and yachting parties frequented the Point.

In 1907 (1895?) the State Government purchased Point Walter, declaring the site as an  A-Class  Reserve. In 1912, the Melville Roads Board was appointed to manage the Reserve.  The Reserve was officially  opened in 1914 on 30 November. 

Today, Point Walter Reserve is a popular well-maintained public recreational area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/2e5c1644-f91d-452f-826e-26100c031ecd" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Melville has had a long association with the Swan River that borders its northern boundaries.

This adventure takes you on a trip along the Swan River visiting some historical places of interest along the way.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Bennett, and later modified in the 1970s and 1980s, has cultural heritage significance for the following reasons: 
- the place is rare as one of the earliest, and the largest and best known commemorative rose garden in Western Australia, dedicated to those who died in World War Two and to peace;  
- the rose garden was intended as a State Memorial, and commemorates service-people from throughout the State; 
- the place is highly valued by the community for social, cultural, spiritual and aesthetic reasons, as a landmark visible reminder and commemoration of the sacrifice made by those who fought in World War Two, and for its contribution to the community’s sense of place; and, it has associations with the National Rose Society, in particular past president, Charles Frost.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Between 1902 and 1904 the Western Australian Government Railway Workshops were relocated to Midland.
The Midland Railway Workshops ran for close to a century on the Eastern fringe of Perth, Western Australia.

Large and multifaceted, the Workshops were vital to the development and maintenance of the West Australian rail system, and a crucial training ground for skilled tradespeople. Their closure in 1994 brought to an end not only a specific industrial complex but also a complex social community.

Despite the harsh, dirty and often dangerous working conditions, many thousands of former workers regretted the loss of the traditions, camaraderie and pride in workmanship that characterised their Midland working lives.

During his time in this position O'Connor faced much opposition and criticism on the basis of limited funding. Despite this, O'Connor's vigorous research meant he was able to succeed in actioning many of his plans that sought to improve the colony. His work saw Western Australia's railway system vastly increased, with lines extending as far as Northam, Coolgardie, and Kalgoorlie.
Conditions in the cramped and ill-equipped maintenance and repair workshops near the Fremantle railway station were also immediately improved, although his attempts to upgrade and relocate the workshops to Midland took 12 years to receive funding.
O'Connor also advanced the wellbeing of Western Australia's railway workers as he vocalised their abhorrent working conditions. This eventuated in better conditions and educational opportunities for these workers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/65f6c6fa-9222-4141-8dde-2ac794576de2" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;O’Connor, the first Engineer in Chief, was born on 11 January 1843 at ‘Gravelmount’, Castletown, near Navan, County Meath, Ireland.
At 17 he began training to become a civil engineer, and he quickly gained experience working on railway construction and water-control projects. In 1865 O'Connor migrated to New Zealand to begin his career in this field.
During his time in New Zealand he worked on projects that involved supplying water to goldmines, improving harbour facilities, and constructing railway tracks, roads, and bridges. This work gained him an international reputation, and led to his election to the Institution of Civil Engineers, London in 1880.
In April 1891, Sir John Forrest, premier of Western Australia, offered O'Connor the position of Engineer-in-Chief working for the Public Works Department. When O'Connor asked whether his responsibilities would cover railways, harbours or roads, Forrest replied with "Everything".

The strip is most famous for its cafes. Quite literally, each block has at least one. As is customary for areas with cafe atmosphere, street art abounds. I’ve picked out 5 locations but there are many more to enjoy. A bike lane does run down the length of the strip on both the eastern and western sides; not the best of designs so use at your own peril.

The spit is also an important site for waterbirds using the Swan River. It is a feeding ground, a resting place and during spring and summer it may be a nesting site for the Black Swan, Pied Oystercatcher, Red-capped Plover and Fairy Tern.
These birds are easily disturbed and frightened off by people walking, fishing, kitesurfing and paddle boarding on and near the spit.

For this reason you don't need to walk to the end!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/6c64c838-c2d3-4291-b34f-aa94c24fc812" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Point Walter Reserve was named after the principal feature on the Swan River, Point Walter, which was originally named by Captain James Stirling in 1827 after a favourite uncle.

When the tide is out, you can walk from the foreshore out into the river along the Point Walter Sandbar. Many people take advantage of this natural phenomenon to snap an interesting photo!

Ample parking is available on Honour Avenue and at the end of Burke Drive.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

It is located 16.0km from Perth and was opened on October 8th 1968&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/b725a41a-cce1-431d-909c-cab48dd07c51" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please be aware the locations for this Adventure Lab are quite a distance from the map marker, make sure you check your nearest Lab point before commencing.

The metropolitan Perth rail network is comprised of five major lines connecting the four Metropolitan Development Corridors and Fremantle to the Perth CBD.

Over the coming years the network is set to expand even further to accomade travelers from Ellenbrook, Forrestfield and extending lines past Armadale to Byford and continuing north to Yanchep.

This Adventure Lab will take you on a tour of the various lines of the Perth Rail Network. You are more than welcome to catch the trains to the stops (it can be done in a single day) if you wish but this is not a requirement, in fact all information can be gained and answered without entering the stations themselves.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Unlike Glen Forrest and Greenmount, Darlington was unplanned. 

From 1890 to 1954, Darlington was served by the Mundaring Loop on the Eastern Railway, which bisected the town.  Darlington was included in "picnic" and "excursion" train itineraries in the 1930s and 1940s, also making it a popular holiday destination.  In 1966, the line was officially closed by an act of parliament and the tracks removed. 

There is an information board located near the given coordinates which will add a lot more explanation to this location and its history.  Please take the time to read it as it is well worth the effort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/84cc0cf3-8d28-4e6d-88c4-bbebe35387d5" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Railway Reserves Heritage Trail follows the route of the old Eastern Railway and is unique in providing a 41 kilometer loop entirely on railway formations. This extensive trail passes through quaint hills communities including Darlington, Parkerville and Mundaring, and covers a wide range of terrains with scenic views and numerous points of historical and natural significance.

This adventure will take you to five different points along the trail and should only take a few hours to complete.  Most can be reached by driving to nearby parking areas with a short stroll to the required locations.  The longest walk is approximately 2 klm round trip between locations 1 and 2.  These trails are well kept and easily accessible to all ages and levels of fitness.

Mobile reception can be patchy along the trail in certain spots, so we have increased the geofence to ensure all relevant information and data is available to you.  Always wear appropriate footwear, hat, sunscreen and carry enough water.

He led the country for the majority of World War II, including all but the last few weeks of the war in the Pacific. He was the leader of the Australian Labor Party (ALP) from 1935 to 1945, and its longest serving leader until Gough Whitlam. Curtin's leadership skills and personal character were acclaimed by his political contemporaries. He is frequently cited as one of Australia's greatest prime ministers.

Curtin joined the Labor Party at a young age and was also involved with the Victorian Socialist Party. He became state secretary of the Timberworkers' Union in 1911 and federal president in 1914.

Curtin was a leader of the "No" campaign during the 1916 referendum on overseas conscription, and was briefly gaoled for refusing to attend a compulsory medical examination. He moved to Perth in 1917 to become the editor of the Westralian Worker,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/b9e0ea1a-1329-4b63-a108-35203c6c0594" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Karrakatta Cemetery first opened for burials in 1899. This historic cemetery is the final resting place of many thousands of Western Australians. Monuments and headstones bear many famous names including those of university founders, writers and historians, state premiers and other historic individuals.

The cemetery is centrally located just seven kilometres west of Perth city centre and is easily accessible by car or train.

Stately stands of cypress trees – a hallmark of Karrakatta – flank the main driveway off Railway Road and preside over beautiful garden areas in the historic heart of the cemetery.

There are two walk trails that will lead you some of the resting places of people in our history that now call Karrakatta Cemetery home.  They can be located at this website:
https://www.mcb.wa.gov.au/our-cemeteries/karrakatta-cemetery/historical-walk-trails

This Adventure Lab will take you to the final resting place of 5 politicians who have left their mark on the State of Western Australia

The land at the Bicton foreshore was granted to John Hole Duffield in 1830.  Duffield named the place Bicton after Bicton near Exeter in England. The Fremantle Race Club operated from the nearby Bicton Race Course from c.1904 to 1917. The Bicton Tearooms were erected near the jetty overlooking Blackwall  Reach to service visitors to the site in c.1917 and run by the Stam Family until demolition in 1964. The Fremantle Quarantine Station was introduced on the sloping site east of the foreshore in c. 1916 until removal to Byford in1983.  It was a Commonwealth Holding Station and all animals, including bees, were obliged to pass through it.  That site and its remnant landscape were then converted to public parkland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/2e5c1644-f91d-452f-826e-26100c031ecd" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Melville has had a long association with the Swan River that borders its northern boundaries.

He was appointed Surveyor General and in 1890 became the first Premier of Western Australia, its only premier as a self-governing colony. Forrest's premiership gave the state ten years of stable administration during a period of rapid development and demographic change. He pursued a policy of large-scale public works and extensive land settlement, and he helped to ensure that Western Australia joined the federation of Australian states. Shortly before his death, Forrest was informed that the King had approved his elevation to the British peerage as Baron Forrest of Bunbury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/b9e0ea1a-1329-4b63-a108-35203c6c0594" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Karrakatta Cemetery first opened for burials in 1899.

Having served on active duty during the First World War, in which he sustained a serious wound to his right leg, Gairdner spent time at the Staff College, Camberley in the interwar period, and served as commanding officer of the 10th Royal Hussars, 6th Armoured Division and 8th Armoured Division during the Second World War. 

Gairdner's distinguished military career was rewarded when he was appointed Governor of Western Australia. He was governor during a number of royal visits to Perth – the earliest being that of Queen Elizabeth II in 1954.

The Perth Chest Hospital was renamed Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital in his honour in May 1963. Gairdner stepped down from his post on 26 June 1963. 

Gairdner died in Nedlands, at the age of 84, and was awarded a state funeral.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/b9e0ea1a-1329-4b63-a108-35203c6c0594" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Karrakatta Cemetery first opened for burials in 1899.

Mr Zuks has had paintings exhibited at the Louvre in Paris, the Venice Biennale and the London Olympics art exhibition.

In 2009 he won the People’s Choice award at Sculptures by the Sea. After wide public consultation, he created Byford’s sculptures of historical figures from ideas put forward by Byford residents.

The works were commissioned by the Byford Progress Association with support from the Shire of Serpentine Jarrahdale.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

A member of the Liberal Party, he was a Member of the Legislative Assembly of Western Australia from 1945 to 1975, and also the 19th and longest-serving Premier of Western Australia, serving four terms from the 1959 to the 1971 election. 

The mining-pastoral boom of the 1960s played a big part in ensuring for Brand's government four successive electoral victories over the ALP opposition . However, the rapid growth of the Perth metropolitan area, and the strain this put on essential services, eroded the government's popularity, especially after 1969. In addition, Brand's relations with the federal Liberal Party worsened after the retirement of Sir Robert Menzies in 1966. 

In 1971 Brand's Coalition lost the election by 1 seat. 

Brand led the Liberals in opposition until his resignation in 1973; Sir Charles Court succeeded him as the party's leader. He died of heart disease in Carnamah, Western Australia in 1979.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/b9e0ea1a-1329-4b63-a108-35203c6c0594" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Karrakatta Cemetery first opened for burials in 1899. This historic cemetery is the final resting place of many thousands of Western Australians. Monuments and headstones bear many famous names including those of university founders, writers and historians, state premiers and other historic individuals.

The cemetery is centrally located just seven kilometres west of Perth city centre and is easily accessible by car or train.

Stately stands of cypress trees – a hallmark of Karrakatta – flank the main driveway off Railway Road and preside over beautiful garden areas in the historic heart of the cemetery.

There are two walk trails that will lead you some of the resting places of people in our history that now call Karrakatta Cemetery home.  They can be located at this website:
https://www.mcb.wa.gov.au/our-cemeteries/karrakatta-cemetery/historical-walk-trails

This Adventure Lab will take you to the final resting place of 5 politicians who have left their mark on the State of Western Australia

Mr Zuks has had paintings exhibited at the Louvre in Paris, the Venice Biennale and the London Olympics art exhibition.

In 2009 he won the People’s Choice award at Sculptures by the Sea. After wide public consultation, he created Byford’s sculptures of historical figures from ideas put forward by Byford residents.

The works were commissioned by the Byford Progress Association with support from the Shire of Serpentine Jarrahdale.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

The strip is most famous for its cafes. Quite literally, each block has at least one. As is customary for areas with cafe atmosphere, street art abounds. I’ve picked out 5 locations but there are many more to enjoy. A bike lane does run down the length of the strip on both the eastern and western sides; not the best of designs so use at your own peril.

Although not renowned for supernatural activity, it is home to the birth place of end.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/8dc1ada0-08ea-4e7e-964c-57a7b3bf56ff" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stories of lost souls, destitute apparitions, shadowy figures with unfinished business and ethereal beings providing protection, fill history books and live within myths across the world. Perth is no different. 

Tales of ghostly encounters can be found across the city and by partaking on this paranormal hunt you may experience your very own unexplained event.

Your adventure covers approximately 53kms and is available anytime however to fully experience possibilities of the afterlife, it is suggested you wait until darkness falls. A good torch will be needed if venturing out after dark.

53,000 people attended the opening ceremony at Perry Lake Stadium on a stinking hot 40 degree day.

The games were a huge success, putting Perth on the international map and spurring development of the city.

This adventure lab takes you to four of the sites used for the games. Collect a clue at each site to solve the coordinates for the bonus cache. It is recommended to start at Beatty Park.

We thought we would share some with you.

Family friendly. To enable those without children to visit each location, it is possible to walk on a paved, public path to answer each question. 

There is no need to enter any playground area, although you’re encouraged to do so. If your bum fits, slide I say.

In 1915, her mother Florence divided her fathers estate into portions for each of their children, and 152 acres was transferred to Azelia.

She began buildings the Manning Tree House (now Azelia Ley Homestead Museum) in 1923, although she only moved into the property in 1927 after her husbands death. She lived on the property and managed her farm until her death in 1954.

In the Early 1980's the City of Cockburn along with some prominent residents decided to restore the residence and transform it into a musuem, which officially opened on 12th November 1983.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/a0918eb8-1ba3-48fd-8f39-679fdc407ba2" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Manning Park is named after the Manning family, who were prominent in the Cockburn area around the 19th century.

Named after Captain Charles Howe Fremantle who arrived at the Swan River Colony on 2 May 1829, on the HMS 'Challenger'. Fremantle had been despatched from the Cape of Good Hope on the 20 March of that year, by Commodore Schomberg of the Indian Squadron, and after anchoring off the mouth of the Swan River, hoisted the British flag on the South Head, and took formal possession in the name of His Majesty King George IV, of "all that part of New Holland which is not included within the territory of New South Wales". The name Fremantle has, at times, and in various records been incorrectly spelt as 'Freemantle'.

The name of the cinema “Beacon Theatre” can still be seen on the façade at the top. It also boasted the Gardens, which was an outdoor cinema at the rear of the building.
It remained a cinema until 1961 when it was converted to Stammers Supermarket and the Gardens became the supermarket carpark.
Stammers moved out around 1995 and it has had a variety of different rolls since then.

If you wish to walk, WPs 1 to 4 will take you through the heritage filled streets of South Fremantle. WP 5 is a bit further south and you will need to drive or cycle.
Parking near WP 1 can be hard to find.
Successfully completing each stage will provide you with some letters that in the end will form a code word to get the final coordinates for a bonus cache (GC8XH3E) that is also in keeping with the theme.

It served the community as a post office until 1984. It was classified by the National Trust in 1985.

To find the answer to the question you will need to find the remains of the original post box which is one the wall in between the 2 windows&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/f6f200df-1948-449f-8636-7e1ccace4548" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This adventure lab will take you to some of the historic sites South of Fremantle that have been recycled and now have other functions.
If you wish to walk, WPs 1 to 4 will take you through the heritage filled streets of South Fremantle. WP 5 is a bit further south and you will need to drive or cycle.
Parking near WP 1 can be hard to find.
Successfully completing each stage will provide you with some letters that in the end will form a code word to get the final coordinates for a bonus cache (GC8XH3E) that is also in keeping with the theme.

The Nyungar Tourist Trail is part of the city's commitment to reconciliation. 
The trail features seagull beach, the lookout and artworks along the way. the trail is located within an important traditional gathering place for the Nyungar people along our coastline.

The trail is centred around the Omeo, Perth’s premier shore-based shipwreck. The dive and snorkel trail features an underwater reef and artworks, which is a first of its kind in WA.

On this Adventure you won't need snorkel equipment however if you would like to stay awhile pleas bring these along and enjoy the area. Only 25 metres from the shore, the dive and snorkel trail begins at the Omeo and includes an artificial reef, underwater sculptures and educational signage. 

There is a walk trail highlighting the Nyungar cultural significance to the area also. 

Be sure to collect the clues at each stage to assist with the Bonus box to find once you have completed the adventure. &lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Phlegm, known for his black and white characters, typically targets and transforms run down urban spaces or factories. He feels that rather than being an awkward canvas in an art gallery, the art becomes part of the city’s architecture.
Unfortunately the artwork has been vandalised but it is one of my favourites and worthy of inclusion.

Parking can be a little difficult along here, so you may find it easier to park at Tuckfield Oval on Tuckfield Street, then walk down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/f4f7d8b4-9fc3-421c-b406-e9655e744eb8" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fremantle has long been renowned for it’s art culture.
In 2013 Fremantle Council took the unorthodox approach of rewriting it’s blanket ban policy on graffiti for one which preserves artistic work that contributes to the culture and vibrancy of the city. 
The result has been the making of a vibrant, edgy city with a surprise around every corner. 
This Adventure Lab will take you to 5 different street art locations in central Fremantle, some well known, some not so well known.

This line passed through Smiths Mill (Glen Forrest) and headed eastwards through Sawyers Valley and Lion Mill (Mt Helena).  However, it was found that the trains were unable to haul economic loads up the steep inclines and also experienced excessive wear &amp; tear from the tight curves in the line.

This resulted in the construction of a second line from Bellevue running roughly parallel to the original line.  Swan View Station was the second station on this line before the rise up the escarpment towards Lion Mill (Mt Helena). The station under went renovations in the late 1990's and is an ideal spot to start the adventure.

There is an information board located near the given coordinates which will add a lot more explanation to this location and its history.  Please take the time to read it as it is well worth the effort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/84cc0cf3-8d28-4e6d-88c4-bbebe35387d5" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Railway Reserves Heritage Trail follows the route of the old Eastern Railway and is unique in providing a 41 kilometer loop entirely on railway formations. This extensive trail passes through quaint hills communities including Darlington, Parkerville and Mundaring, and covers a wide range of terrains with scenic views and numerous points of historical and natural significance.

This adventure will take you to five different points along the trail and should only take a few hours to complete.  Most can be reached by driving to nearby parking areas with a short stroll to the required locations.  The longest walk is approximately 2 klm round trip between locations 1 and 2.  These trails are well kept and easily accessible to all ages and levels of fitness.

Mobile reception can be patchy along the trail in certain spots, so we have increased the geofence to ensure all relevant information and data is available to you.  Always wear appropriate footwear, hat, sunscreen and carry enough water.

Mr Zuks has had paintings exhibited at the Louvre in Paris, the Venice Biennale and the London Olympics art exhibition.

In 2009 he won the People’s Choice award at Sculptures by the Sea. After wide public consultation, he created Byford’s sculptures of historical figures from ideas put forward by Byford residents.

The works were commissioned by the Byford Progress Association with support from the Shire of Serpentine Jarrahdale.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

In 1829, the very first vines were planted at Olive Farm in South Guildford by botanist Thomas Waters. He recognised that the region’s warm climate and dry summers were the perfect recipe for grape growing.

In 1840, the first vines were planted at Sandalford. While Sandalford is best known for its wines today, the Roe family were initially significant table grape producers for the region.

The 1850s saw the emergence of a new generation of land owners in the Swan Valley. During this time, the demand for dried fruit, fresh table grapes, export table grapes and colonial wine saw an abundance of new plantings.

The coordinates will take you to  the western side of the West Swan Road.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/bc1cff31-a979-47e8-849a-54b605eddcf8" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the Swan Valley, known for its Viticulture, Breweries and its Tourism.  Follow Captain James Stirling's journey as he made his way along the Swan River in 1827 to settle a colony.  
Along the way there is plenty to see, get your taste buds working and sample some produce from well known establishments along the way.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Housed in the heritage listed, Artillery Barracks built between 1910 and 1913 was the home for artillerymen tasked to defend the Port of Fremantle and is now one of the largest military museums in Australia. 

The museum reflects the history of the Australian Army in Western Australia and the service of Western Australians’ service within the army from the colonial period through to the present day.

There are many military museums from Albany in the South, Broome in the North, and Kalgoorlie in the East. 

This series looks at some of the local military sites in the Perth area, which includes World War II Tunnels, local Telecommunications, Spitfires, Tanks and Artillery. 

Most museums have restricted opening hours, however the WWII Tunnels and tours of HMAS Ovens are temporarily suspended due to Covid-19.

The WWII Tunnels location in Mosman Park will take some physical effort to reach the site, however there is a path for wheelchairs and people with walking aides. Please follow the Directional Signs from the Boundary Road Carpark to the Heritage Site - approximately 350 metres.

This chimney is all that remains of the Fremantle Freezing Works. The freezing and cooling works were built in 1921 to support the Robb's Jetty Abattoir. Cattle  and sheep would arrive by boat or train. Before the long jetty was built the cattle would be off loaded off the beach and made to swim to shore. 
The area was also home to skin drying sheds and tanneries. Driving down Cockburn Rd in those days was not a pleasant experience.
The abattoir was shut down in 1992 and all the equipment was removed by 1994 and the building demolished.

If you wish to walk, WPs 1 to 4 will take you through the heritage filled streets of South Fremantle. WP 5 is a bit further south and you will need to drive or cycle.
Parking near WP 1 can be hard to find.
Successfully completing each stage will provide you with some letters that in the end will form a code word to get the final coordinates for a bonus cache (GC8XH3E) that is also in keeping with the theme.

The battery initially consisted of two 6-inch Mk VII naval guns, operational from February 1943. The two guns were removed in 1945 and replaced by three 5.25 inch dual purpose coastal artillery/antiaircraft guns. 

While it was envisioned to have all major ports in Australia protected by these type guns, the Leighton Battery became the only one ever operational. The battery was dismantled and the equipment disposed of for scrap in 1963.

There are many military museums from Albany in the South, Broome in the North, and Kalgoorlie in the East. 

This series looks at some of the local military sites in the Perth area, which includes World War II Tunnels, local Telecommunications, Spitfires, Tanks and Artillery. 

Most museums have restricted opening hours, however the WWII Tunnels and tours of HMAS Ovens are temporarily suspended due to Covid-19.

There are interpretative signs on the board walk. Timber used for grandstand seating, and signs from around the venue, were recycled and used in landscaping around the redeveloped site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/90fe87fe-9fc1-41a1-9679-0e959d6be564" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 1962 British Empire and Commonwealth Games were held in Perth from 22 November to 1 December 1962. 863 athletes from 35 countries participated in nine sports – athletics, bowls, boxing, cycling, fencing, rowing, swimming, weightlifting and wrestling.

53,000 people attended the opening ceremony at Perry Lake Stadium on a stinking hot 40 degree day.

The games were a huge success, putting Perth on the international map and spurring development of the city.

This adventure lab takes you to four of the sites used for the games. Collect a clue at each site to solve the coordinates for the bonus cache. It is recommended to start at Beatty Park.

Built in the 1860’s, the chequered history of the building begins with convict hands laying the all the stone in Gothic architecture. 
It was the Swan Colony’s lunatic asylum and dumping ground for the states most disturbed and those deemed invalid. Over the years overcrowding lead to the suspicious death of a patient, Ms Clifford.

In later years the building became a women’s home with stories of mistreatment, escapes and suicide. 

Lingering souls roam the halls and have been known to touch visitors, drop temperatures and even making appearances whilst whispering to those unwilling to listen.

Perth is no different. 

Tales of ghostly encounters can be found across the city and by partaking on this paranormal hunt you may experience your very own unexplained event.

Your adventure covers approximately 53kms and is available anytime however to fully experience possibilities of the afterlife, it is suggested you wait until darkness falls. A good torch will be needed if venturing out after dark.

The Nyungar Tourist Trail is part of the city's commitment to reconciliation. 
The trail features seagull beach, the lookout and artworks along the way. The trail is located within an important traditional gathering place for the Nyungar people along our coastline. 

Keep a lookout for the artwork on the ground as you walk through the area.

The trail is centred around the Omeo, Perth’s premier shore-based shipwreck. The dive and snorkel trail features an underwater reef and artworks, which is a first of its kind in WA.

On this Adventure you won't need snorkel equipment however if you would like to stay awhile pleas bring these along and enjoy the area. Only 25 metres from the shore, the dive and snorkel trail begins at the Omeo and includes an artificial reef, underwater sculptures and educational signage. 

There is a walk trail highlighting the Nyungar cultural significance to the area also. 

Be sure to collect the clues at each stage to assist with the Bonus box to find once you have completed the adventure. &lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

The first recorded burial here was on the 3rd April 1831. It remained in service until 1855 when the cemetery in Skinner St was opened. After that date the only people buried at this site were those that had close relatives here.
This cemetery was closed in 1895 and some of the bodies were exhumed and taken to the current Fremantle cemetery or Karrakatta.
Early Recycling.
When the cemetery was closed not all of the headstones were moved to the new cemeteries. Some were used as slabs for footpaths and one was later discovered as the hearthstone in an old house.

The stadium was demolished in 2012 and replaced with a housing estate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/90fe87fe-9fc1-41a1-9679-0e959d6be564" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 1962 British Empire and Commonwealth Games were held in Perth from 22 November to 1 December 1962. 863 athletes from 35 countries participated in nine sports – athletics, bowls, boxing, cycling, fencing, rowing, swimming, weightlifting and wrestling.

53,000 people attended the opening ceremony at Perry Lake Stadium on a stinking hot 40 degree day.

The games were a huge success, putting Perth on the international map and spurring development of the city.

This adventure lab takes you to four of the sites used for the games. Collect a clue at each site to solve the coordinates for the bonus cache. It is recommended to start at Beatty Park.

It is best enjoyed by cycling, running or walking on the paths around the lake. Collect answers at each location to calculate the final coordinates for a bonus traditional geocache.

The Herdsman Lake Regional Park consists of native bush, parklands, an inner wetland and a dredged outer moat consisting of four deep permanent water bodies joined by small channels. 

It is a popular spot for birdwatchers. The lake is a breeding site for at least 20 species of birds including black swans. Please take care around the grassy areas as there may be tiger snakes.

The adventure is designed to start and finish at the car park on the south-west side of the lake, and to go clockwise around the lake. However, you can visit the locations in any order.

Their challenge at the prison was to take a set of 12 keys and search the convict towers for the cell that one of their keys would open. On a hot day for filming, temperatures in towers reached the high 30's and teams struggled to complete the assigned task.

Luckily for you there is an easier task awaiting for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/59ba51eb-26ca-4ea3-b29a-9d8f9fb679a9" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Amazing Race is a reality television program that started in the US in 2001.

It sees teams race against each other around the world, completing challenges along the way to get the next piece of information needed to continue on the race.

The first season of The Amazing Race Australia was in 2011. It saw 11 teams race around the world going to 10 countries and covering over 50 000km. The series culminated in the final three teams racing around Perth completing challenges attempting to arrive at the check-in point first and claim a $250 000 prize.

In this recreation of the final leg you will have to make your way along the same route that the teams did to claim your final prize, not cash but a cache (GC9G7E2).&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Over its 136 year operation, 44 people had their lives ended in the gallows of the prison. 

With such a grim history, Fremantle Prison is said to be the second most haunted location in WA. After hours, past convicts are said to roam the cold corridors looking for redemption, retribution or just to plead innocence. 

Martha Rendall, convicted of the murders of her own three children, was only female sentenced to death at the prison. Legend has it, she remains and has been sighted watching in the chapel window.

Stories of a ghost named Jack exist after he breathed on visitors with tainted breath.

Oddly, owls have been noted landing by the gallows on the anniversaries of those whose finished this world here.

To the left of the entrance, is an Australian Convict Site monument. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/8dc1ada0-08ea-4e7e-964c-57a7b3bf56ff" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stories of lost souls, destitute apparitions, shadowy figures with unfinished business and ethereal beings providing protection, fill history books and live within myths across the world. Perth is no different. 

Tales of ghostly encounters can be found across the city and by partaking on this paranormal hunt you may experience your very own unexplained event.

Your adventure covers approximately 53kms and is available anytime however to fully experience possibilities of the afterlife, it is suggested you wait until darkness falls. A good torch will be needed if venturing out after dark.

The Prison was a place of hangings, floggings, dramatic convict escapes and prisoner riots.

The Convict Establishment, as the prison was first known, was built by convict labour between 1852 and 1859 using limestone quarried on the site. The first prisoners moved into the main cell block in 1855.

It was renamed Fremantle Prison in 1867.

Fremantle Prison was decommissioned on 8 November 1991 and its prisoners transferred to Casuarina Prison, replacing Fremantle Prison as the state's main maximum-security prison.

After its closure the WA state government embarked on a long-term conservation plan to ensure the Prison’s preservation for future generations. Fremantle Prison is one of the largest surviving convict prisons in the world today.

Find address number 12 on the outside of the prison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/7ba2105b-269b-4f75-9d77-8a158e9cdf1e" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Take a trip visiting the early European history of the Western Australia colony.

Indigenous Australians have been occupying Western Australia for around 40,000 to 60,000 years.

The first recorded European contact was in 1616 when Dutch explorer Dirk Hartog landed on the west coast but the first permanent settlement was not made until 1826 when a settlement was established at Albany to formally take possession of the western third of the continent of Australia for the British Crown.  The Swan River Colony was established in 1829 starting the official history of European settlement of Western Australia.

This set of lab caches explores the early buildings and places of the Swan River Colony.

If you wish to walk, WPs 1 to 4 will take you through the heritage filled streets of South Fremantle. WP 5 is a bit further south and you will need to drive or cycle.
Parking near WP 1 can be hard to find.
Successfully completing each stage will provide you with some letters that in the end will form a code word to get the final coordinates for a bonus cache (GC8XH3E) that is also in keeping with the theme.

The Nyungar Tourist Trail is part of the city's commitment to reconciliation. 
The trail features seagull beach, the lookout and artworks along the way. the trail is located within an important traditional gathering place for the Nyungar people along our coastline. 

Keep a lookout for the artwork on the ground as you walk through the area. 

The start of the trail is here at Socrates Park.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/6941e632-d2fa-4859-9303-d9a032681801" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Coogee Trail features both underwater and land-based activities. The trail is centred around the Omeo, Perth’s premier shore-based shipwreck. The dive and snorkel trail features an underwater reef and artworks, which is a first of its kind in WA.

On this Adventure you won't need snorkel equipment however if you would like to stay awhile pleas bring these along and enjoy the area. Only 25 metres from the shore, the dive and snorkel trail begins at the Omeo and includes an artificial reef, underwater sculptures and educational signage. 

There is a walk trail highlighting the Nyungar cultural significance to the area also. 

Be sure to collect the clues at each stage to assist with the Bonus box to find once you have completed the adventure. &lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Part of its cargo on its maiden voyage to Australia were the materials and equipment for laying the Bass Strait submarine cable. After many years carrying passengers and cargo between Melbourne and Adelaide and then  New Zealand Omeo was sent to Port Darwin in 1870 on charter to the  contractors  completing the northern section of the Overland Telegraph line linking Australia to Britain via Singapore.  She then played a major part in the construction of the overland telegraph line from Darwin, carrying telegraph poles and cargo 160 km up the Roper River. After making over 100 round trips to New Zealand her engines were removed in 1880 and her funnel replaced with a new mast. As a 4-masted ‘jackass barque’ ( Two square and two barque rigged masts). In that distinctive livery Omeo voyaged between Melbourne and Newcastle and  it traded for many years in the Pacific and Indian Oceans carrying passengers and cargo.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/6941e632-d2fa-4859-9303-d9a032681801" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Coogee Trail features both underwater and land-based activities. The trail is centred around the Omeo, Perth’s premier shore-based shipwreck. The dive and snorkel trail features an underwater reef and artworks, which is a first of its kind in WA.

On this Adventure you won't need snorkel equipment however if you would like to stay awhile pleas bring these along and enjoy the area. Only 25 metres from the shore, the dive and snorkel trail begins at the Omeo and includes an artificial reef, underwater sculptures and educational signage. 

There is a walk trail highlighting the Nyungar cultural significance to the area also. 

Be sure to collect the clues at each stage to assist with the Bonus box to find once you have completed the adventure. &lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

The underwater art gallery includes a giant sea star which divers can swim through, an old railway wheel, anchor and Dutch inspired replica cannon and a sea lion near the shore. You can experience a large variety a marine life on the trail including a variety of fish, starfish, cuttlefish, nudibranchs, sea squirts and corals.

The purpose-built reef consists ofover 55 reef modules, ranging in height from 1m to 5m tall. The reef has been designed by marine engineers and scientists to support a diverse range of aquatic flora and fauna. The unique sections create a complex reef that includes lots of cave-like spaces to support fish, crays and molluscs and are great for snorkelling and scuba diving.  Larger species will be attracted to the tall reef temple which includes a swim through.
The reef will weigh over 30 tonnes in total, and all reef modules are fabricated from fibre-reinforced concrete.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/6941e632-d2fa-4859-9303-d9a032681801" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Coogee Trail features both underwater and land-based activities.

Significance: Proclamation tree; commemorative tree planted in 1890 by Governor H.E. Sir William Robinson to mark granting of responsible government of the WA colony. The stone and memorial plaque associated with the tree are also significant. 
Unfortunately the plaque is missing but an information sign is in place. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/c378ab2c-ff17-4c4b-b2ae-c27b615e8f45" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The National Trusts of Australia are community based, non government organisations, committed to promoting and conserving Australia’s indigenous, natural and historic heritage places and objects. The National Trusts of Australia are collaborating to create a national register of significant trees, which is consistent with their mission to protect and celebrate Australia’s heritage. There are over 2,500 significant tree records compiled over thirty years across Australia. 
This adventure lab focuses on five trees 100+ years of age. 
Jarrah Tree - Armadale: Historic value; at 1500+ years, this tree reflects the great age of the species and is a significant remnant of the period prior to European colonisation.
Scientific value; the girth and age of this Eucalyptus margin at a makes it valuable as a benchmark site with potential to contribute to future research. Unfortunately it has been significantly impacted by development and vandalism.

The artwork, a relief portrait etched into the side of The Norfolk Hotel, features Dame Dorothy Tangney, an Australian personality, a Fremantle resident and first female member of the Australian senate.
Vihls' work often depicts the faces of individuals often unknown within the community.
He creates his artworks by breaking his portraits into 3 colours, then uses these colours to provide depth. He is best known for his use of etching using acid, pneumonic drills, bleach and even explosives.
If you stand at the base of the wall you can see in some areas the initial rough outline in spray paint used to sketch his first design. Pneumonic drill marks are also visible into the plaster and brick which he used to develop the depth needed in the portrait.
Vihls' believes that destruction is a form of construction.

In 2013 Fremantle Council took the unorthodox approach of rewriting it’s blanket ban policy on graffiti for one which preserves artistic work that contributes to the culture and vibrancy of the city. 
The result has been the making of a vibrant, edgy city with a surprise around every corner. 
This Adventure Lab will take you to 5 different street art locations in central Fremantle, some well known, some not so well known.

It is best enjoyed by cycling, running or walking on the paths around the lake. Collect answers at each location to calculate the final coordinates for a bonus traditional geocache.

The Herdsman Lake Regional Park consists of native bush, parklands, an inner wetland and a dredged outer moat consisting of four deep permanent water bodies joined by small channels. 

It is a popular spot for birdwatchers. The lake is a breeding site for at least 20 species of birds including black swans. Please take care around the grassy areas as there may be tiger snakes.

The adventure is designed to start and finish at the car park on the south-west side of the lake, and to go clockwise around the lake. However, you can visit the locations in any order.

It is a popular spot for birdwatchers. The lake is a breeding site for at least 20 species of birds including black swans. Please take care around the grassy areas as there may be tiger snakes.

The adventure is designed to start and finish at the car park on the south-west side of the lake, and to go clockwise around the lake. However, you can visit the locations in any order.

There are 52 trees, aged 120+ with an average girth of 0.9m.  
Significance: the area was planted by two residents of John Street, William Zimpel and John Doscas in 1905. 
The trees are of outstanding aesthetic quality and occur in a unique location or provides a significant contribution to the landscape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/c378ab2c-ff17-4c4b-b2ae-c27b615e8f45" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The National Trusts of Australia are community based, non government organisations, committed to promoting and conserving Australia’s indigenous, natural and historic heritage places and objects. The National Trusts of Australia are collaborating to create a national register of significant trees, which is consistent with their mission to protect and celebrate Australia’s heritage. There are over 2,500 significant tree records compiled over thirty years across Australia. 
This adventure lab focuses on five trees 100+ years of age. 
Jarrah Tree - Armadale: Historic value; at 1500+ years, this tree reflects the great age of the species and is a significant remnant of the period prior to European colonisation.
Scientific value; the girth and age of this Eucalyptus margin at a makes it valuable as a benchmark site with potential to contribute to future research. Unfortunately it has been significantly impacted by development and vandalism.

Birdbath who can often be found here making additions to his work.
He has many other mini artworks around the city including the planter boxes and bollards around Market Street and near the wall.
Horatio, a quirky and loveable character started the wall in 2002 and has gradually added to it over the many years and is made using mostly acrylic markers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/f4f7d8b4-9fc3-421c-b406-e9655e744eb8" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fremantle has long been renowned for it’s art culture.
In 2013 Fremantle Council took the unorthodox approach of rewriting it’s blanket ban policy on graffiti for one which preserves artistic work that contributes to the culture and vibrancy of the city. 
The result has been the making of a vibrant, edgy city with a surprise around every corner. 
This Adventure Lab will take you to 5 different street art locations in central Fremantle, some well known, some not so well known.

The popularity of the Bondi event led to the creation of a Cottesloe event in 2005 - which is now enjoyed by around 250,000 visitors annually.

The event is free and each event showcases around 70 sculptures. The exhibition is featured from the sea wall all the way along the sand towards North Cottesloe and on the surrounding grassed areas creating a beautiful sculpture park.

The 18th Annual Cottesloe Exhibition is scheduled for 4-21 March 2022.

The public can commission and buy sculptures, and since the first Cottesloe exhibition the Town of Cottesloe has also regularly purchased sculptures for ongoing public display.

This Adventure Lab takes you to a few of the permanent sculptures along a 2km stretch of coast - perfect for a nice walk, cycle, drive, skateboard, scooter or hoverboard.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Located 18.7km from Perth. The current station was opened on July 1st 1907 and is situated 300m north east of the original station that opened March 1st 1881.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/b725a41a-cce1-431d-909c-cab48dd07c51" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please be aware the locations for this Adventure Lab are quite a distance from the map marker, make sure you check your nearest Lab point before commencing.

The metropolitan Perth rail network is comprised of five major lines connecting the four Metropolitan Development Corridors and Fremantle to the Perth CBD.

Over the coming years the network is set to expand even further to accomade travelers from Ellenbrook, Forrestfield and extending lines past Armadale to Byford and continuing north to Yanchep.

This Adventure Lab will take you on a tour of the various lines of the Perth Rail Network. You are more than welcome to catch the trains to the stops (it can be done in a single day) if you wish but this is not a requirement, in fact all information can be gained and answered without entering the stations themselves.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Engineer Charles O'Connor designed the 340m Swan View Tunnel to overcome a granite barrier formed by a fold in the Darling Range.

A deviation was built around the tunnel in 1945.  This was due to a number of fatalities caused by the slow upward progress of the trains in the tunnel coupled with poor ventilation.  The deviation was then used by the "up trains", while the "down trains" continued to use the tunnel as they could coast through at greater speeds.  The tunnel ceased to be used after the new Avon Valley rail route was opened in 1966.

Make sure you bring a torch to check out some of the interesting features inside the tunnel, such as the masonry-lined face &amp; roof which was carried out to prevent rock falls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/84cc0cf3-8d28-4e6d-88c4-bbebe35387d5" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Railway Reserves Heritage Trail follows the route of the old Eastern Railway and is unique in providing a 41 kilometer loop entirely on railway formations. This extensive trail passes through quaint hills communities including Darlington, Parkerville and Mundaring, and covers a wide range of terrains with scenic views and numerous points of historical and natural significance.

This adventure will take you to five different points along the trail and should only take a few hours to complete.  Most can be reached by driving to nearby parking areas with a short stroll to the required locations.  The longest walk is approximately 2 klm round trip between locations 1 and 2.  These trails are well kept and easily accessible to all ages and levels of fitness.

Mobile reception can be patchy along the trail in certain spots, so we have increased the geofence to ensure all relevant information and data is available to you.  Always wear appropriate footwear, hat, sunscreen and carry enough water.

This takes you through a wooded section parallel with Perry Lakes Drive. The first stop is in front of where Camel Lake used to be. In 1875 Ernest Giles rested his camels here after his historic trek from Port Augusta to Perth. In 1890s it became a temporary quarantine station for camels imported for transportation to and from the Goldfields. The first question is about the person Bold Park is named after.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/50e7e046-d21e-4d63-a9d3-b4977538d3a5" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On this adventure lab, enjoy a challenging 6-7km walk/run on limestone paths through Bold Park. The Park is one of the largest remaining bushland remnants in the Perth urban area with Xamia palms, Tuart and Banksia trees. Along the way there are views of the Indian Ocean, Perth city and the suburbs of Floreat and City Beach. 

The adventure lab is designed to start and finish at the Camel Lake car park, near the corner of Stephenson Ave and Perry Lakes Drive (S 31 56.880, E 115 46.830). There are five stops along the way to answer questions and receive clues to a bonus cache in Perry Lakes.

Allow one to two hours to complete the 6-7km loop along Camel Lake Trail, Zamia Trail and Yoorn Walk. There are some steep uphill and downhill sections. It requires a moderate level of fitness.

The name Swanbourne commemorates the home of Thomas Francis Fremantle, 1st Baron Cottesloe.. He was the brother of Captain Charles Howe Fremantle RN. after whom Fremantle is named. Swanbourne was at first referred to as Cottesloe Beach, and the first homes in the area were built around 1890.  To some the nearby beach is better known as where clothing is optional.

It was dangerous work for the 300 workers who had only picks, shovels and dynamite to work with.
The roof was sealed with more than 330,000 bricks. The tunnel is 340m long and was considered a major engineering achievement in its day. The bypass around the tunnel was built in 1945. The tunnel's small diameter combined with the steep gradient (1:49) to cause smoke accumulation. Incidents involving near-asphyxiation of train crews started in 1896, and continued throughout the tunnel's operating life. The first serious incident of this nature was in 1903.
The tunnel's design was incompatible with the ASG class Garratt steam locomotives used by the Western Australian Government Railways in the 1940s. The subsequent Royal Commission into the ASG dealt with design of the locomotive, and the very dangerous clearances and was used until the line was closed in 1966.

At 17 he began training to become a civil engineer, and he quickly gained experience working on railway construction and water-control projects. In 1865 O'Connor migrated to New Zealand to begin his career in this field.
During his time in New Zealand he worked on projects that involved supplying water to goldmines, improving harbour facilities, and constructing railway tracks, roads, and bridges. This work gained him an international reputation, and led to his election to the Institution of Civil Engineers, London in 1880.
In April 1891, Sir John Forrest, premier of Western Australia, offered O'Connor the position of Engineer-in-Chief working for the Public Works Department. When O'Connor asked whether his responsibilities would cover railways, harbours or roads, Forrest replied with "Everything".

The pines were planted some time after 1917 when Perth City Council bought the land and started to create a park. After a steep downhill you will arrive at the fifth and final station.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/50e7e046-d21e-4d63-a9d3-b4977538d3a5" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On this adventure lab, enjoy a challenging 6-7km walk/run on limestone paths through Bold Park. The Park is one of the largest remaining bushland remnants in the Perth urban area with Xamia palms, Tuart and Banksia trees. Along the way there are views of the Indian Ocean, Perth city and the suburbs of Floreat and City Beach. 

The adventure lab is designed to start and finish at the Camel Lake car park, near the corner of Stephenson Ave and Perry Lakes Drive (S 31 56.880, E 115 46.830). There are five stops along the way to answer questions and receive clues to a bonus cache in Perry Lakes.

Allow one to two hours to complete the 6-7km loop along Camel Lake Trail, Zamia Trail and Yoorn Walk. There are some steep uphill and downhill sections. It requires a moderate level of fitness.

Even though the area is often very busy with people sitting around on the grass you can usually find this seat free. Nice shady spot too :)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/abb4eb2a-8ff8-4016-883e-b279e2019ff2" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sculpture by the Sea started in Bondi in 1997 and quickly grew to become one of Sydney's most popular annual events. The popularity of the Bondi event led to the creation of a Cottesloe event in 2005 - which is now enjoyed by around 250,000 visitors annually.

The event is free and each event showcases around 70 sculptures. The exhibition is featured from the sea wall all the way along the sand towards North Cottesloe and on the surrounding grassed areas creating a beautiful sculpture park.

The 18th Annual Cottesloe Exhibition is scheduled for 4-21 March 2022.

The public can commission and buy sculptures, and since the first Cottesloe exhibition the Town of Cottesloe has also regularly purchased sculptures for ongoing public display.

This Adventure Lab takes you to a few of the permanent sculptures along a 2km stretch of coast - perfect for a nice walk, cycle, drive, skateboard, scooter or hoverboard.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Much of this maritime history is on show at the WA Shipwreck Museum in the heart of beautiful Fremantle. Housed in a restored 1850's-era Commissariat building, this museum is recognized as the foremost maritime archaeology museum in the Southern Hemisphere. 

The Adlab begins in the grounds outside the museum and continues through various themed  galleries inside. 

NB: Entry to the museum is free though a small donation is appreciated. The museum is generally open between 9.30am and 5pm each day.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Their artworks can be seen all around Perth and are typically bright and punchy.
This one was created as part of PUBLIC 2015, an art project which saw 45 artists from around the world transform spaces and walls around Perth into an urban canvas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/f4f7d8b4-9fc3-421c-b406-e9655e744eb8" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fremantle has long been renowned for it’s art culture.
In 2013 Fremantle Council took the unorthodox approach of rewriting it’s blanket ban policy on graffiti for one which preserves artistic work that contributes to the culture and vibrancy of the city. 
The result has been the making of a vibrant, edgy city with a surprise around every corner. 
This Adventure Lab will take you to 5 different street art locations in central Fremantle, some well known, some not so well known.

Don’t forget to collect the clues after each stage to claim the bonus cache at the end 'Fremantle Street Art Bonus Cache' GC9MAQ2.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

The tale of the Batavia shipwreck and subsequent mutiny and massacre  make for gruesome reading.
Make your way inside the museum to the Batavia gallery where some of the original timbers of the Batavia as well as cargo, replica portico and a skeleton of a crew member who met a fateful death are all masterfully displayed. If you are standing in front of a small information board entitled "Batavia timbers", you are in the right spot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/70cbc252-3d08-488b-af97-2c822f48a868" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With almost 21,000 kms of coastline, it is little wonder that shipwrecks feature prominently in the history of Western Australia. Much of this maritime history is on show at the WA Shipwreck Museum in the heart of beautiful Fremantle. Housed in a restored 1850's-era Commissariat building, this museum is recognized as the foremost maritime archaeology museum in the Southern Hemisphere. 

The Adlab begins in the grounds outside the museum and continues through various themed  galleries inside. 

NB: Entry to the museum is free though a small donation is appreciated. The museum is generally open between 9.30am and 5pm each day.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

The Museum is housed in 1850s-era Commissariat building and has since been restored to its historic glory.

Steeped in history, the galleries house hundreds of relics from ships wrecked along WA’s treacherous coastline, including the original timbers from the Batavia (wrecked in 1629), the de Vlamingh Dish, and also countless artifacts from the Dutch shipwrecks Zuytdorp, Zeewijk and Vergulde Draeck.

On the wall to the left of the main entrance in front of the anchors is a plaque.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/7ba2105b-269b-4f75-9d77-8a158e9cdf1e" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Take a trip visiting the early European history of the Western Australia colony.

Indigenous Australians have been occupying Western Australia for around 40,000 to 60,000 years.

The first recorded European contact was in 1616 when Dutch explorer Dirk Hartog landed on the west coast but the first permanent settlement was not made until 1826 when a settlement was established at Albany to formally take possession of the western third of the continent of Australia for the British Crown.  The Swan River Colony was established in 1829 starting the official history of European settlement of Western Australia.

This set of lab caches explores the early buildings and places of the Swan River Colony.

People arrived on three ships, Gilmore, Hooghly and Rockingham between December 1829 and May 1830. They set up makeshift camps in primitive condition. In the first year 40 settlers died of scurvy, dysentery and other ailments including six women due to childbirth. The majority of the deceased were originally buried at this location with a number re in - interred in the Old Alma Street Cemetery in Fremantle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/fcadfa12-a873-4c41-a962-0a7361395bb0" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Woodman Point a area rich in history with hidden treasures waiting to be found.

Lack of rainfall and an absence of large quantities of fresh water meant that these communities were left to live in inadequate and unsanitary living conditions. Between 1896-1898, the Goldfields had a death rate of 16 per thousand, largely due to the prevalence of typhoid fever.
In 1895 O’Connor completed details of a plan to construct a 560km pipeline that would pump water from Mundaring to the Goldfields. The pipeline would be capable to supply these communities with more than 20 million litres of water each day.
The magnitude of this project led to significant opposition and criticism in Parliament regarding its practicality. The cost of constructing the pipeline would be equal to the colony's entire annual budget. After much debate and delay the scheme was finally granted funding  and permission in 1898 and was completed in January 1903.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/65f6c6fa-9222-4141-8dde-2ac794576de2" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;O’Connor, the first Engineer in Chief, was born on 11 January 1843 at ‘Gravelmount’, Castletown, near Navan, County Meath, Ireland.
At 17 he began training to become a civil engineer, and he quickly gained experience working on railway construction and water-control projects. In 1865 O'Connor migrated to New Zealand to begin his career in this field.
During his time in New Zealand he worked on projects that involved supplying water to goldmines, improving harbour facilities, and constructing railway tracks, roads, and bridges. This work gained him an international reputation, and led to his election to the Institution of Civil Engineers, London in 1880.
In April 1891, Sir John Forrest, premier of Western Australia, offered O'Connor the position of Engineer-in-Chief working for the Public Works Department. When O'Connor asked whether his responsibilities would cover railways, harbours or roads, Forrest replied with "Everything".

A branch of the train line was built running high alongside the building so the coal could be tipped out into a large bin near the boilers room.
Timber was cheaper and plentiful so the boilers were converted to wood. The smoke from the chimney burning timber caused the original steel chimney to corrode and it was replaced in 1910 with the 41.5m brick chimney you see today. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/5cc175bb-6ecc-4c58-86bc-a572a7753b28" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No 1 Pump Station sits in an area known as Minderinjy to the local Whadjuk people at the foot of Mundaring Weir, which dams the Helena River, 39 km east of Perth.
The river was a traditional east-west travel route for corroborees in what is now called the suburb of Guildford. The damming of this river has changed the cultural landscape dramatically.
No 1 Pump Station was the first of eight steam pump stations constructed as part of the Goldfields Water Supply Scheme, designed by CY O’Connor to transfer water over a distance of 560 km from the Perth hills to the WA Goldfields to bring precious water to this notoriously dry part of the state.

In sweltering heat on 22 January 1903, Lady Margaret Forrest, wife of Sir John Forrest, ceremoniously started the engines at No 1 Pump Station to open the scheme. It was her husband, then a federal politician, who had obtained a loan and parliamentary approval to build the Goldfields Water Supply Scheme under his premiership of WA.

It is 5pm and the large crowd is sweating in the evening heat. The former Premier of Western Australia, Sir John Forrest, steps forward and with a simple twist of a valve sends a stream of water gushing into the reservoir. The longest freshwater pipeline in the world has ever seen is eventually open. 
Behind the towering concrete wall is a storage reservoir that is fed by the Helena River, direct rainfall run-off and water pumped from other sources.
Look at the digital display of water flow; each time it changes, another 1000 litres of water are pumped from Mundaring Weir to begin the long 560km journey east.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/5cc175bb-6ecc-4c58-86bc-a572a7753b28" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No 1 Pump Station sits in an area known as Minderinjy to the local Whadjuk people at the foot of Mundaring Weir, which dams the Helena River, 39 km east of Perth.

Firewood was cut from the surrounding Forrest and delivered by train, horde drawn carts and later trucks. It was fed into fire-boxes beneath enormous Babcock and Wilcox boilers. The steam generated was used to power the engines that pumped the water uphill and along the pipeline. The boilers were kept going 24 hours a day with the men working Eight hour shifts.

Made from aluminium and black oxide.

The inaugural sculpture purchased (entitled 'Four Pots') can be found in the grounds of the nearby Civic Centre. Feel free to divert there along Napier Street if time allows however please note the gates to the grounds close at 5pm daily (hence not included in this AL trail).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/abb4eb2a-8ff8-4016-883e-b279e2019ff2" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sculpture by the Sea started in Bondi in 1997 and quickly grew to become one of Sydney's most popular annual events. The popularity of the Bondi event led to the creation of a Cottesloe event in 2005 - which is now enjoyed by around 250,000 visitors annually.

The event is free and each event showcases around 70 sculptures. The exhibition is featured from the sea wall all the way along the sand towards North Cottesloe and on the surrounding grassed areas creating a beautiful sculpture park.

The 18th Annual Cottesloe Exhibition is scheduled for 4-21 March 2022.

The public can commission and buy sculptures, and since the first Cottesloe exhibition the Town of Cottesloe has also regularly purchased sculptures for ongoing public display.

This Adventure Lab takes you to a few of the permanent sculptures along a 2km stretch of coast - perfect for a nice walk, cycle, drive, skateboard, scooter or hoverboard.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Although the wall was raised, overflows still occurred until the 1960's.  With a growing population &amp; a drying climate, the Lower Helena Dam was created to pump water back to the weir.

It is dodecagonal, having twelve sides, and was built as a jail in 1830-1 (twenty years before convicts arrived).

This makes it the oldest public building in the State. 

During 1966 the standard gauge railway was extended past the end of High Street and the original steps were partly demolished and rebuilt in their present form.

You are looking for an information plaque to the right side of the steps up to the main entrance to the Round House.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/7ba2105b-269b-4f75-9d77-8a158e9cdf1e" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Take a trip visiting the early European history of the Western Australia colony.

Indigenous Australians have been occupying Western Australia for around 40,000 to 60,000 years.

The first recorded European contact was in 1616 when Dutch explorer Dirk Hartog landed on the west coast but the first permanent settlement was not made until 1826 when a settlement was established at Albany to formally take possession of the western third of the continent of Australia for the British Crown.  The Swan River Colony was established in 1829 starting the official history of European settlement of Western Australia.

This set of lab caches explores the early buildings and places of the Swan River Colony.

It took more than 1000 turns of a wheel to open or close the valves so luckily they were for emergencies only. The main controls were in the upper valve house which is on the top of the dam wall. 
It is believed both valve houses were designed by prominent WA Government architect George Temple Poole.
The lower valve house is no longer used.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/5cc175bb-6ecc-4c58-86bc-a572a7753b28" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No 1 Pump Station sits in an area known as Minderinjy to the local Whadjuk people at the foot of Mundaring Weir, which dams the Helena River, 39 km east of Perth.
The river was a traditional east-west travel route for corroborees in what is now called the suburb of Guildford. The damming of this river has changed the cultural landscape dramatically.
No 1 Pump Station was the first of eight steam pump stations constructed as part of the Goldfields Water Supply Scheme, designed by CY O’Connor to transfer water over a distance of 560 km from the Perth hills to the WA Goldfields to bring precious water to this notoriously dry part of the state.

In sweltering heat on 22 January 1903, Lady Margaret Forrest, wife of Sir John Forrest, ceremoniously started the engines at No 1 Pump Station to open the scheme. It was her husband, then a federal politician, who had obtained a loan and parliamentary approval to build the Goldfields Water Supply Scheme under his premiership of WA.

Because of the gradient, the train had to zigzag down to the dam site. 
The railway also brought coal and later wood for the No1. Pump Station. 
The landscaped grounds of the weir, and the lower zig-zag section of the end of the railway line (which can still be seen when the capacity of the dams falls below approximately 35%) feature prominently in postcards of numerous weekend and special picnic excursion trains that travelled to the weir from the 1910s.
After the 1920’s wood was trucked in, the tracks were covered when the height of the wall was increased between 1948-51.

I like this one as the steel free form reminds me of the way I used to try and bend my Scalextric as a kid!

This sculpture was donated to the Town by the Bernadt Family. Maybe they had a Scalextric set too :)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/abb4eb2a-8ff8-4016-883e-b279e2019ff2" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sculpture by the Sea started in Bondi in 1997 and quickly grew to become one of Sydney's most popular annual events. The popularity of the Bondi event led to the creation of a Cottesloe event in 2005 - which is now enjoyed by around 250,000 visitors annually.

The event is free and each event showcases around 70 sculptures. The exhibition is featured from the sea wall all the way along the sand towards North Cottesloe and on the surrounding grassed areas creating a beautiful sculpture park.

The 18th Annual Cottesloe Exhibition is scheduled for 4-21 March 2022.

The public can commission and buy sculptures, and since the first Cottesloe exhibition the Town of Cottesloe has also regularly purchased sculptures for ongoing public display.

This Adventure Lab takes you to a few of the permanent sculptures along a 2km stretch of coast - perfect for a nice walk, cycle, drive, skateboard, scooter or hoverboard.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Sadly he died a tragic death in 1902 leaving behind his wife Susan to which they had 8 children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/8fd2b6fd-31f2-4a79-8e94-15d370f26e67" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Located in the Perth Hills, the Mundaring Weir is one of the world's greatest engineering projects.

Completed in 1903, the weir is the start of the water pipeline that pumps water to the Kalgoorlie goldfields some 700km away.

We have created this adventure lab to highlight some of the history &amp; beauty of the precinct.  

Mundaring Weir is a great spot to take the family &amp; the little ones will enjoy feeding the birds, enjoy!

The Park is one of the largest remaining bushland remnants in the Perth urban area with Xamia palms, Tuart and Banksia trees. Along the way there are views of the Indian Ocean, Perth city and the suburbs of Floreat and City Beach. 

The adventure lab is designed to start and finish at the Camel Lake car park, near the corner of Stephenson Ave and Perry Lakes Drive (S 31 56.880, E 115 46.830). There are five stops along the way to answer questions and receive clues to a bonus cache in Perry Lakes.

Allow one to two hours to complete the 6-7km loop along Camel Lake Trail, Zamia Trail and Yoorn Walk. There are some steep uphill and downhill sections. It requires a moderate level of fitness.

He wrote in his recommendations that the hilly and rocky catchment would fill the reservoir each year.

This spot will take you to a fantastic viewing point of the weir wall iconic inner valve tower.  Don't forget your camera!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/8fd2b6fd-31f2-4a79-8e94-15d370f26e67" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Located in the Perth Hills, the Mundaring Weir is one of the world's greatest engineering projects.

Completed in 1903, the weir is the start of the water pipeline that pumps water to the Kalgoorlie goldfields some 700km away.

We have created this adventure lab to highlight some of the history &amp; beauty of the precinct.  

Mundaring Weir is a great spot to take the family &amp; the little ones will enjoy feeding the birds, enjoy!

The Museum houses several unique galleries that explore WA's maritime relationship. From leisure boats and handcrafted sailing boats to commercial pearl luggers, the Museum inspires visitors to discover WA’s affinity with the ocean.

To the left of the museum lies the 89 metre (295 feet) long Oberon class Submarine, HMAS Ovens. It is an authentic Cold War-era vessel situated on Fremantle's historic World War Two submarine slipway, part of the home base for an Allied submarine fleet, which was stationed here during the war.  Amongst controls, sensors, tactical equipment and torpedoes, 63 people lived and served aboard the vessel in extremely cramped conditions.

The HMAS Ovens exhibit serves as a living memorial to submariners and those who gave their lives while serving from Fremantle during World War Two.

There are many military museums from Albany in the South, Broome in the North, and Kalgoorlie in the East. 

This series looks at some of the local military sites in the Perth area, which includes World War II Tunnels, local Telecommunications, Spitfires, Tanks and Artillery. 

Most museums have restricted opening hours, however the WWII Tunnels and tours of HMAS Ovens are temporarily suspended due to Covid-19. 

Important: 
The WWII Tunnels location in Mosman Park will take some physical effort to reach the site, however there is a path for wheelchairs and people with walking aides. Please follow the Directional Signs from the Boundary Road Carpark to the Heritage Site - approximately 350 metres.

Mr Zuks has had paintings exhibited at the Louvre in Paris, the Venice Biennale and the London Olympics art exhibition.

In 2009 he won the People’s Choice award at Sculptures by the Sea. After wide public consultation, he created Byford’s sculptures of historical figures from ideas put forward by Byford residents.

The works were commissioned by the Byford Progress Association with support from the Shire of Serpentine Jarrahdale.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Rosa signed up to train as a battlefield nurse in 1915 and was called up in 1917. On 11 November 1918, she was bound for Europe on the SS Wyreema to serve as part of the Australian Army Nursing Service when the Armistice was declared. Following her ship’s return to Perth, she volunteered to tend to World War I servicemen suffering from pneumonic-influenza – the Spanish flu – who, while returning to Australia on board the transport ship SS Boonah, were struck down with it.
Between 1918 and 1920, the Spanish Flu plagued society. This pandemic caused more deaths than World War I.
To prevent the spread of the Spanish flu, those on board the SS Boonah were unable to disembark and reunite with family for some time. Sister O’Kane was tending to soldiers at the Woodman Point Quarantine Station to the south of Fremantle, WA, when she too became ill and died on 21 December 1918. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/fcadfa12-a873-4c41-a962-0a7361395bb0" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Woodman Point a area rich in history with hidden treasures waiting to be found.

He &amp; his wife lived in this area in the old stationmasters house &amp; his wife sold tea &amp; flowers from the nearby rose garden to the hundreds of visitors that would visit the dam by train each weekend.

Today there is also a new playground as well as electric BBQs &amp; toilets, but the rose garden &amp; exotic gardens still stand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/8fd2b6fd-31f2-4a79-8e94-15d370f26e67" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Located in the Perth Hills, the Mundaring Weir is one of the world's greatest engineering projects.

Completed in 1903, the weir is the start of the water pipeline that pumps water to the Kalgoorlie goldfields some 700km away.

We have created this adventure lab to highlight some of the history &amp; beauty of the precinct.  

Mundaring Weir is a great spot to take the family &amp; the little ones will enjoy feeding the birds, enjoy!

It was constructed in the early 1900's and closed in 1983.
This depot was used extensively between World War 1 and 2.
The explosive magazines were set back from the beach in the sand dunes, surrounded by sandbag barriers. The red brick buildings have very thick walls and high set windows.
Remnants of these structures can still be found throughout Woodman Point today

The Park is one of the largest remaining bushland remnants in the Perth urban area with Xamia palms, Tuart and Banksia trees. Along the way there are views of the Indian Ocean, Perth city and the suburbs of Floreat and City Beach. 

The adventure lab is designed to start and finish at the Camel Lake car park, near the corner of Stephenson Ave and Perry Lakes Drive (S 31 56.880, E 115 46.830). There are five stops along the way to answer questions and receive clues to a bonus cache in Perry Lakes.

Allow one to two hours to complete the 6-7km loop along Camel Lake Trail, Zamia Trail and Yoorn Walk. There are some steep uphill and downhill sections. It requires a moderate level of fitness.

It is best enjoyed by cycling, running or walking on the paths around the lake. Collect answers at each location to calculate the final coordinates for a bonus traditional geocache.

The Herdsman Lake Regional Park consists of native bush, parklands, an inner wetland and a dredged outer moat consisting of four deep permanent water bodies joined by small channels. 

It is a popular spot for birdwatchers. The lake is a breeding site for at least 20 species of birds including black swans. Please take care around the grassy areas as there may be tiger snakes.

The adventure is designed to start and finish at the car park on the south-west side of the lake, and to go clockwise around the lake. However, you can visit the locations in any order.

Mr Zuks has had paintings exhibited at the Louvre in Paris, the Venice Biennale and the London Olympics art exhibition.

In 2009 he won the People’s Choice award at Sculptures by the Sea. After wide public consultation, he created Byford’s sculptures of historical figures from ideas put forward by Byford residents.

The works were commissioned by the Byford Progress Association with support from the Shire of Serpentine Jarrahdale.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

It was previously known as the Reservoir Hotel, then the Goldfields Weir Hotel and has been in the area since 1898. It was a crucial location where C Y O'Connor stayed regularly during the construction of the weir.

MHI site 50 - The Mundaring Weir Hotel has very high social, historic and aesthetic significance, both locally and State, for its associations with the Weir’s construction, operation and tourist activities together with its two storey architectural style of which there are only several examples in the Shire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/5ed890c9-75a3-435c-b521-bf5e55a0aecf" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

We invite you to visit some local Heritage Listed establishments within the Mundaring LGA - this adventure should take between 1 - 2 hours.  The required information is able to be accessed 24/7.



Municipal Heritage Inventory -
It is mandatory under the Heritage of Western Australia Act 1990 for each local government
to maintain a Municipal Heritage Inventory (MHI). The Shire of Mundaring MHI lists many
places that contribute to the history and character of the local area and classifies them
according to the degree of significance. Modification of places on the MHI may not always
require planning approval, although sympathetic design is still recommended to maintain the
character and heritage values.

The Park is one of the largest remaining bushland remnants in the Perth urban area with Xamia palms, Tuart and Banksia trees. Along the way there are views of the Indian Ocean, Perth city and the suburbs of Floreat and City Beach. 

The adventure lab is designed to start and finish at the Camel Lake car park, near the corner of Stephenson Ave and Perry Lakes Drive (S 31 56.880, E 115 46.830). There are five stops along the way to answer questions and receive clues to a bonus cache in Perry Lakes.

Allow one to two hours to complete the 6-7km loop along Camel Lake Trail, Zamia Trail and Yoorn Walk. There are some steep uphill and downhill sections. It requires a moderate level of fitness.

The interpretative sign gives some interesting history about the area. 

The first people to use this site were the local Noongar people, the Yellagonga, who call the area Ngurghboro and used it as a food resource. In the 1930s the once-thick bush around the lake was transformed into pastures for horse stables and five-acre market gardens. In the early 1990s the north west section, known as Floreat Lakes, was rezoned for residential development.

After this location you will pass by the Perth Horse and Pony Club grounds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/f31219a6-70d9-4285-8fe6-6a1f720a71e1" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This adventure lab will take you on a 7km loop around Herdsman Lake. It is best enjoyed by cycling, running or walking on the paths around the lake. Collect answers at each location to calculate the final coordinates for a bonus traditional geocache.

The Herdsman Lake Regional Park consists of native bush, parklands, an inner wetland and a dredged outer moat consisting of four deep permanent water bodies joined by small channels. 

It is a popular spot for birdwatchers. The lake is a breeding site for at least 20 species of birds including black swans. Please take care around the grassy areas as there may be tiger snakes.

The adventure is designed to start and finish at the car park on the south-west side of the lake, and to go clockwise around the lake. However, you can visit the locations in any order.

The harbour needed to accommodate the royal mail contractors whose vessels were the largest steamers entering Australia.
The entrance to the Swan River, which had been outlined as the harbour site, was obstructed by a large limestone bar. 
After extensive research, O'Connor proposed the removal of the limestone bar with explosives and further clearing through dredging. By doing this, O'Connor demonstrated that an extensive sheltered harbour with opportunity for future extension could be built. O'Connor's harbour was officially opened in 1897 and in 1900 the mail station was altered from Albany to Fremantle. For his work on Fremantle Harbour O'Connor was invited to London where he was inducted as a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/65f6c6fa-9222-4141-8dde-2ac794576de2" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;O’Connor, the first Engineer in Chief, was born on 11 January 1843 at ‘Gravelmount’, Castletown, near Navan, County Meath, Ireland.
At 17 he began training to become a civil engineer, and he quickly gained experience working on railway construction and water-control projects. In 1865 O'Connor migrated to New Zealand to begin his career in this field.
During his time in New Zealand he worked on projects that involved supplying water to goldmines, improving harbour facilities, and constructing railway tracks, roads, and bridges. This work gained him an international reputation, and led to his election to the Institution of Civil Engineers, London in 1880.
In April 1891, Sir John Forrest, premier of Western Australia, offered O'Connor the position of Engineer-in-Chief working for the Public Works Department. When O'Connor asked whether his responsibilities would cover railways, harbours or roads, Forrest replied with "Everything".

Back in the 1960s, Lew constructed a dam across the southern end of an ephemeral lake along Bennett Brook, creating a pool which now remains year-round. When water levels are low, you can see the weir wall construction well.

Freshwater mussels which were once prolific in the area are found in the waterbody, and so it was named Mussel Pool. Now, it is a scenic picnic area favoured by Park visitors endeavouring to find a quiet spot amongst the shady trees.

Mussel Pool is an important wetland habitat, as the lake holds water almost year-round. Classed as a Conservation category lake, the area is home to healthy population of brushtail possums (Trichosurus vulpecula), nine amphibian species, numerous birdlife and the long-necked turtle (Chelodina oblonga).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/0823e411-d9ef-4ac9-901d-a0a757367e16" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Whiteman Park is a 4,000-hectare bushland area located 22 km north of Perth, WA. The park is in the suburb of Whiteman, in the Swan Valley in the upper reaches of the Swan River.
It encompasses the source of Bennett Brook - an important place of the Nyoongar people, and a source of mythology of the Wagyl and stories about Aboriginal occupancy of the area.
Whiteman Park is known for its biodiversity, including more than 450 endemic plants and more than 120 vertebrate animals (some of which are rare and endangered). More than 17% of Western Australian bird species occur in Whiteman Park, including migratory birds attracted to the habitat provided by Bennett Brook and associated wetlands including Grogan's Swamp, a Conservation Category Wetland.
The state government purchased the land from a number of private owners in 1978 to protect the underlying aquifer as a drinking water source for Perth. The major owner was Lew Whiteman (1903–1994), after whom the park is named.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

The series follows the CircleRoute bus service, one of Perth's high frequency family of bus services. The CircleRoute bus service operates with up to 1228 weekly services.

There are 5 lab locations, one at each station where the CircleRoute crosses a train line. A bonus final cache is located in Fremantle, the start and end point of the CircleRoute.

Make sure you also pick up the 17 traditional caches located at each timing point along the CircleRoute. &lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

The site included a recreation hall, dining hall, shops and an administration building. 

It has been said that the Games Village was the most enduring legacy of the games because of the influence that the subdivision and building design had on the subsequent development of Perth suburbs.

A shopping centre, on the site of the old dining hall, burnt down in 2014. The shopping centre was rebuilt and named Empire Village, drawing on the history of the site.

There are a lot of interpretative signs about the 1962 Commonwealth Games on the north side of the car park, and inside and outside the verandas.

53,000 people attended the opening ceremony at Perry Lake Stadium on a stinking hot 40 degree day.

The games were a huge success, putting Perth on the international map and spurring development of the city.

This adventure lab takes you to four of the sites used for the games. Collect a clue at each site to solve the coordinates for the bonus cache. It is recommended to start at Beatty Park.

It also served the nearby farmers and workers who commuted to Midland.

The famous line of palms determine the old platform and the nearby pad is still visible where the Station Masters house stood.

The rail line ceased being used in 1966.

This extensive trail passes through quaint hills communities including Darlington, Parkerville and Mundaring, and covers a wide range of terrains with scenic views and numerous points of historical and natural significance.

This adventure will take you to five different points along the trail and should only take a few hours to complete.  Most can be reached by driving to nearby parking areas with a short stroll to the required locations.  The longest walk is approximately 2 klm round trip between locations 1 and 2.  These trails are well kept and easily accessible to all ages and levels of fitness.

Mobile reception can be patchy along the trail in certain spots, so we have increased the geofence to ensure all relevant information and data is available to you.  Always wear appropriate footwear, hat, sunscreen and carry enough water.

Entry to the Children’s Forest is free and children, together with their friends and family, are encouraged to explore, enjoy and discover the many wonders of the Forest, including giant marching ants, colourful birds, peeking possums, a life size Wedge-Tailed Eagle’s nest made of steel and the Forest’s ‘guardians’, the Boy of the Bush and his sister Fern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/0823e411-d9ef-4ac9-901d-a0a757367e16" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Early in 1925, Western Australia’s third Surf Life Saving Club was formed.
In 1938 more substantial accommodation was built, and 30 years later those clubrooms were replaced by today’s facility in time for the club to host the 1971 Australian Surf Life Saving Championships. In 2014 the club underwent a major transformation as a part of the redevelopment of City Beach by the Town of Cambridge.
There are now well over 1200 members ranging from the very young to the very old, and facilities including clubrooms with a magnificent view overlooking the beach, exhaustive lifesaving and competition equipment, a well-equipped gymnasium, a bar and social facilities.

The Association was formed on the 26th of April 1976 by a group of friends who shared an interest in the lesser known narrow gauge railways of Western Australia. Construction of the Bennett Brook Railway was started in the early 1980’s.

Starting from small beginnings in a member’s backyard, the railway has evolved to a fully fledged railway operation based in Whiteman Park. Today it encompasses relocated heritage railway infrastructure using heritage locomotives and carriages from all over Australia and the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/0823e411-d9ef-4ac9-901d-a0a757367e16" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Whiteman Park is a 4,000-hectare bushland area located 22 km north of Perth, WA. The park is in the suburb of Whiteman, in the Swan Valley in the upper reaches of the Swan River.
It encompasses the source of Bennett Brook - an important place of the Nyoongar people, and a source of mythology of the Wagyl and stories about Aboriginal occupancy of the area.
Whiteman Park is known for its biodiversity, including more than 450 endemic plants and more than 120 vertebrate animals (some of which are rare and endangered). More than 17% of Western Australian bird species occur in Whiteman Park, including migratory birds attracted to the habitat provided by Bennett Brook and associated wetlands including Grogan's Swamp, a Conservation Category Wetland.
The state government purchased the land from a number of private owners in 1978 to protect the underlying aquifer as a drinking water source for Perth. The major owner was Lew Whiteman (1903–1994), after whom the park is named.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

The first general meeting that called for the forming of an official and fully functional committee was in 1957. In 1958, it was voted to change the club's name from North City to Floreat. Between 1947 and 1962, the clubrooms were wooden change rooms located just in front of the site. In 1962, new and larger clubrooms were build on the hill, closer to the main and popular area near the groyne. This location enabled easy patrolling of all the Floreat Beach, and a good position to keep watch for potential dangers. Those clubrooms were extended on two occasions (1966 &amp; 1972).
In April 1978 the coast was lashed by cyclone Alby and the clubrooms could not be saved from the eroded coastline. A small group of supporters and members successfully lobbied to maintain the Floreat SLSC, threatened of being amalgamated with the nearby City of Perth SLSC. The present day facilities were built in 1981.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/1b3833c7-e4ba-4779-a7a1-798e221e747d" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This Adventure Lab is a tribute to all the volunteers who keep our beaches safe.

Metro operated an intensive bus service between Perth and Fremantle which was the route this bus would have been used on for many years. It was acquired for preservation from a property in Southern Cross in 1974 and has been fully restored by the members of the Bus Preservation Society of W.A. 
Parts from sister bus Metro 24 including its petrol engine were used to complete the restoration.  Restoration was completed in 2005.  The bus is registered for road use and is regularly used around Whiteman Park and at community events around Perth and Fremantle. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/0823e411-d9ef-4ac9-901d-a0a757367e16" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

The original Eastern Railway passed through Mundaring on its first route through to Chidlow, and Mundaring Station was known as the central point for the region.  It also played a significant role for the construction of the Mundaring Weir and associated rail lines.

Following the construction of the second route of the Eastern Railway, the Mundaring line served as an alternative to the second route at the time of accidents and derailments, until its closing to traffic in 1954. 

As with the other locations, there are several information boards near the given coordinates that look at all the different locations and attractions the area has to offer, such as Mundaring Weir, located south of Mundaring on Mundaring Weir Rd.

This is also a good place to finish the adventure with the park, play areas, picnic tables and BBQ’s.

This extensive trail passes through quaint hills communities including Darlington, Parkerville and Mundaring, and covers a wide range of terrains with scenic views and numerous points of historical and natural significance.

This adventure will take you to five different points along the trail and should only take a few hours to complete.  Most can be reached by driving to nearby parking areas with a short stroll to the required locations.  The longest walk is approximately 2 klm round trip between locations 1 and 2.  These trails are well kept and easily accessible to all ages and levels of fitness.

Mobile reception can be patchy along the trail in certain spots, so we have increased the geofence to ensure all relevant information and data is available to you.  Always wear appropriate footwear, hat, sunscreen and carry enough water.

Mundaring is a pleasant town on the eastern edge of the Perth Hills. It's famous in Western Australia for the Mundaring Weir which, through the remarkable engineering achievements of Charles Yelverton O'Connor, has supplied water to towns in the wheatbelt and the gold towns of Kalgoorlie and Coolgardie. Since the dam was built people have come from Perth to marvel at this watery saviour of the Eastern Goldfields. 
In this adventure we'll explore a few locations of interest in the Mundaring townsite.  All waypoints are located in walking distance and can easily be completed in under an hour.  But be sure to take some time to enjoy all that this charming little town has to offer.

The redevelopment was supported by Lotterywest and the Department of Parks and Wildlife and incorporates a playzone where children will be able to enjoy a range of new equipment and a nature play area. One of the key attractions is the Ornate Crevice Dragon located in the sandpit, where children can dig for her eggs and insects.
There is also the boardwalk tunnel onto the equipment and rocks to climb. With ramps, soft fall and many accessible equipment pieces, this is an inclusive playground for the whole community.
Shaded areas are also available, with free gas BBQs, picnic tables, public toilets, information boards and a series of specially commissioned sculptural works featuring some of Western Australia's best known artists.
The Railway Reserves Heritage Trail passes through the park, which is also the&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/e819f454-c863-4344-ba64-c0dc289f2626" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Mundaring.  Mundaring is a pleasant town on the eastern edge of the Perth Hills. It's famous in Western Australia for the Mundaring Weir which, through the remarkable engineering achievements of Charles Yelverton O'Connor, has supplied water to towns in the wheatbelt and the gold towns of Kalgoorlie and Coolgardie. Since the dam was built people have come from Perth to marvel at this watery saviour of the Eastern Goldfields. 
In this adventure we'll explore a few locations of interest in the Mundaring townsite.  All waypoints are located in walking distance and can easily be completed in under an hour.  But be sure to take some time to enjoy all that this charming little town has to offer.

It was originally called The Railway Hotel and later The Parkerville Hotel before adopting its current name in the 1970s.

In 2016 the Parkerville Tavern was listed on Western Australia’s Heritage Register for the contribution made by the place to Western Australia’s cultural heritage.

The MHI site 71 - The Parkerville Tavern has very high aesthetic significance for the style, scale and landmark value the building has which are rare both in the Townsite and the Shire generally.  The Tavern also has high social significance for the role and focus the place has provided, and should continue to provide for Parkerville’s community.

Municipal Heritage Inventory -
It is mandatory under the Heritage of Western Australia Act 1990 for each local government
to maintain a Municipal Heritage Inventory (MHI). The Shire of Mundaring MHI lists many
places that contribute to the history and character of the local area and classifies them
according to the degree of significance. Modification of places on the MHI may not always
require planning approval, although sympathetic design is still recommended to maintain the
character and heritage values.

It also has open grassy spaces, benches, water fountains, BBQ facilities, toilets, hotel, fast food, cafes and convenience stores close by. 

There is plenty of parking however can get very busy on the weekends.

We have always loved parks and playgrounds so we thought a perfect theme for our series would revolve around some in the Mundaring area.  

This series will only take about an hour to complete, depending if you can pry the kids away from the swings.

Each has plenty of parking, good phone reception and amenities close by.

Please Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

As well as posts and telegraphs, from sometime after 1912, the post office, in common with many others, operated as a Commonwealth Savings Bank Agency. The original post office is now used as a playgroup centre. In early 1926, in line with the shift of the commercial centre of Mundaring from the railway line side of town to the York Road (Great Eastern Highway), a new weatherboard and iron post office was opened on the corner of York Road and Nichol Street.  In June 1997, after some internal modifications, the former post office building re-opened as the Mundaring Art Gallery, which had previously operated from a converted service station in Great Eastern Highway Mahogany Creek.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/e819f454-c863-4344-ba64-c0dc289f2626" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Mundaring.

The Home was founded in 1903 by the Sisters of the Anglican Church.  When a child died, the Sisters would carry the simple coffins by horse and cart along the small dirt track from the Home.

The Cemetery is located 3 kms west of the Home at the end of a gravel road (Wilson Rd). There are approximately 30 babies &amp; young children buried in the cemetery who died between 1903 and 1919, but the names of only 24 are known. They are listed on a plaque by the entrance gate.

This Lab should take about 2 hours to complete and all sites should have good phone coverage. 

While you are visiting the various locations please take the opportunity to read a few of the headstones, finding about the area and the history of the people who are laid to rest there.  Sometimes it may give a hint as to what they did and where they originated from. 

Very importantly, please remember where you are and show the appropriate respect for the residents and people visiting them.

There is also an optional bonus mystery cache to find once you have finished.  You will need to collect the clues provided in the journals to solve the puzzle and get the cache coordinates.  

Good luck and have fun!

They also manage campsite bookings and general enquiries for Lake Leschenaultia.

The Centre houses the district museum, so it is well worth a visit to learn more about the history of the area, as well as a retail section stocked with a selection of souvenirs, local produce, walk and cycle trails, including the long distance Bibbulmun Track and Munda Biddi Trail, regional maps and general information.

Perth Hills Mundaring Visitor Centre is open seven days; from 9.30am to 4pm Monday to Saturday and 10am to 2.30pm on Sundays and most public holidays (closed Ch&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/21959691-17ba-4c36-b7c3-8273019465a6" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We all like exploring new areas and geocaching does this by taking us to spots where we would not have known about or ever thought to go.  Another way would be to visit the Visitor Centre's at those locations which will have some great advice and can showcase local attractions.

This Lab takes you on a tour of the Visitor Centre's around the Perth Hills area and nearby satellite towns.

You will need to allow an afternoon to take a leisurely drive throughout the district to complete this adventure lab and claim the bonus at the end.  It is recommended that you start at Mundaring and follow through to Toodyay, Northam, York and finally Beverley - however you can do them in any order you choose.

Good Luck and enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

It has a great playground with slides, tunnels, rope ladders, monkey bars and a large sandpit.  It also has undercover picnic tables and plenty of benches to sit at and watch all the activity going on around you.

You will also find toilets, fast food outlets and convenience stores close by. 

There is plenty of parking however can get busy at times.

We have always loved parks and playgrounds so we thought a perfect theme for our series would revolve around some in the Mundaring area.  

This series will only take about an hour to complete, depending if you can pry the kids away from the swings.

Each has plenty of parking, good phone reception and amenities close by.

Please Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

You guessed it, all is not okay with the world, a man has been found murdered.  

There were five seemingly innocent people in the house besides the victim: the Wife, the Butler, the Gardener, the Cook and the Maid.

The Police are called to interview all five and with your help make an arrest.

So, who was it?

Go to each location in sequence to get the nominated suspects alibi.  One might not add up??  Once you have made your deductions, go to the Bonus Cache page (GC9QCDZ) and input your suspect into Certitude, as per the instructions to get the final location.

So what are you waiting for, let's START this Adventure.

You guessed it, all is not okay with the world, a man has been found murdered.  

There were five seemingly innocent people in the house besides the victim: the Wife, the Butler, the Gardener, the Cook and the Maid.

The Police are called to interview all five and with your help make an arrest.

So, who was it?

Go to each location in sequence to get the nominated suspects alibi.  One might not add up??  Once you have made your deductions, go to the Bonus Cache page (GC9QCDZ) and input your suspect into Certitude, as per the instructions to get the final location.

So what are you waiting for, let's START this Adventure.

Before the creation of Mundaring Cemetery families travelled to Midland and Guildford for funerals.

The earliest burials took place in the Anglican section of the cemetery and the earliest headstone that survives is that of Albert Lemmey, who died at the age of three in 1916. The next recorded burial was that of Private Gordon Jacque of the 28th Battalion. Jacques had been gassed during World War I and returned home for care, dying shortly afterwards in January 1919. His brother carved the timber enclosure that surrounds the grave.
The Mundaring Cemetery is administered by the Shire of Mundaring and, since 2007, is no longer available for interments unless already reserved.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/d145caeb-98e9-4811-8d6d-8e37e1682ce8" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This Adventure Lab takes you on a short tour of some of the oldest and most interesting cemetery’s around East Perth and the Hills area's.  This Lab should take about 2 hours to complete and all sites should have good phone coverage. 

While you are visiting the various locations please take the opportunity to read a few of the headstones, finding about the area and the history of the people who are laid to rest there.  Sometimes it may give a hint as to what they did and where they originated from. 

Very importantly, please remember where you are and show the appropriate respect for the residents and people visiting them.

There is also an optional bonus mystery cache to find once you have finished.  You will need to collect the clues provided in the journals to solve the puzzle and get the cache coordinates.  

Good luck and have fun!

This plaque marks the location of a beach house used by WA writer Tom Hungerford (1915-2011).
Tom Hungerford is remembered for his novels The Ridge and the River, set in the islands of Papua New Guinea during World War II, and Sowers of the Wind: A Novel of the Occupation of Japan.
He also wrote autobiographical works, Stories From Suburban Road, Knockabout with a Slouch Hat and Red Rover All Over published in one book called Straightshooter by the Fremantle Arts Centre Press.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/48498caf-36fd-4cf3-a819-120b5c5f1b75" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A little wander along some of the beachside suburbs of Perth North of the River, checking out landmarks and historic spots.

Scarborough Beach is located approximately 14kms from Perth CBD and is well served through high-frequency public transport making it easily accessible to the greater Perth metropolitan area. 
In 2018, the club marked its 90th anniversary and moved into new purpose built facilities as part of the Scarborough Foreshore Redevelopment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/1b3833c7-e4ba-4779-a7a1-798e221e747d" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This Adventure Lab is a tribute to all the volunteers who keep our beaches safe. It will take you to the Surf Life Saving Clubs between City Beach and Sorrento. It can be done in any order but the Bonus cache is at the Northern end of the Adventure Lab locations.
Please enter all answers in lowercase.
Hope you enjoy this AL, and don't forget to collect the clues for the Bonus which can be found at:

The very 70's design of the Clock Tower means the time can be seen from many angles:  Rotarian David Taggart, who owned Scarborough Pharmacy for 50 years, said Scarborough parents wanted a clock so their children would never have an excuse to be late home from a day at the beach.  
In 2017, the Clock Tower was moved west 7 metres during the multi million dollar foreshore redevelopment and is no longer at the centre of the roundabout.
It is on the WA State Register of Historical places.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/48498caf-36fd-4cf3-a819-120b5c5f1b75" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A little wander along some of the beachside suburbs of Perth North of the River, checking out landmarks and historic spots.

Supa Golf is like regular Golf but more fun, they have a front 9 holes and back 9. The front 9 being the easier of the two.
There are lots of cover from the trees and it is usally not to hot.

It has benches, swings, slides, balancing and climbing equipment including a large sandpit!

Parking might be an issue, though there are a few spots you can pull off the road for a short stop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/8228662f-9b6b-498f-ae3f-705b0234ef20" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Welcome to our Adventure Lab Cache designed by kids for kids!

We have always loved parks and playgrounds so we thought a perfect theme for our series would revolve around some in the Mundaring area.  

This series will only take about an hour to complete, depending if you can pry the kids away from the swings.

Each has plenty of parking, good phone reception and amenities close by.

Please Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

It boasts a selection of craft beers and ciders, a rustic restaurant and extensive grounds with a play area for the kids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/5f5ebda9-0d65-4e22-ba61-6bcbb26516e4" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If discovering quality, unique craft beers and wine is at the top of your geocaching 'to do' list, the Peel Region Craft Beer and Wine Trail makes it easy for you. We have included five of the locations in this Adventure. The trail provides an authentically local experience, to be enjoyed at your own pace. You will need to hop into the geomobile and go for a drive through some attractive countryside in the Peel Region. You do not have to enter the establishment......but then again.....Why not?

You will find toilets, BBQ facilities and some picnic tables.  Parking may become a problem when there are any sporting events on at the nearby oval.

The playground has swings, slides, ladders, sandpit and numerous other activities to keep the kids amused.

There is also a service station and hotel close by.

We have always loved parks and playgrounds so we thought a perfect theme for our series would revolve around some in the Mundaring area.  

This series will only take about an hour to complete, depending if you can pry the kids away from the swings.

Each has plenty of parking, good phone reception and amenities close by.

Please Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

It was originally called the Sawyers Valley Hotel before acquiring its current name.

In 2016 the Sawyers Valley Tavern was listed on Western Australia's Heritage Register for the contribution made by the place to Western Australia's cultural heritage

MHI site 230 - The Sawyers Valley Tavern has high aesthetic and social significance for the local community and the Shire of Mundaring. The aesthetic significance is highlighted by the building's Art Deco character that is unique in the Shire. The site also has historic significance as the location of Lot Leather's former store and hotel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/5ed890c9-75a3-435c-b521-bf5e55a0aecf" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

We invite you to visit some local Heritage Listed establishments within the Mundaring LGA - this adventure should take between 1 - 2 hours.  The required information is able to be accessed 24/7.



Municipal Heritage Inventory -
It is mandatory under the Heritage of Western Australia Act 1990 for each local government
to maintain a Municipal Heritage Inventory (MHI). The Shire of Mundaring MHI lists many
places that contribute to the history and character of the local area and classifies them
according to the degree of significance. Modification of places on the MHI may not always
require planning approval, although sympathetic design is still recommended to maintain the
character and heritage values.

Since its inception, the Club has had three premises, the latest being built in 1993. Trigg Island is renowned for its infamous Blue Hole, which has claimed many lives over the years, although its notoriety has diminished more recently due to changes in the structure of the metropolitan coastline. Nevertheless it is the Club’s proud boast to have never lost a life in patrolled areas, and that more than 50% of all rescues carried out in Western Australia are at Trigg beach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/1b3833c7-e4ba-4779-a7a1-798e221e747d" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This Adventure Lab is a tribute to all the volunteers who keep our beaches safe. It will take you to the Surf Life Saving Clubs between City Beach and Sorrento. It can be done in any order but the Bonus cache is at the Northern end of the Adventure Lab locations.
Please enter all answers in lowercase.
Hope you enjoy this AL, and don't forget to collect the clues for the Bonus which can be found at:

This northern part of the Perth coast was only developed in the 1950s, with the Trigg Island Surf Life Saving Club being established in 1954. In its first two years of operation it rescued 47 people from the more hazardous surf at this end of the beach.
The surf club patrols the northern 1.5 km of the beach including the infamous Blue Hole, a permanent rip that runs out on the south side of the island, and has been the scene of many rescues. Furthermore, like adjoining South Trigg and Scarborough beaches, waves are higher along Trigg Beach, and the continuous bar is more likely to be cut by rips and rip channels, making this one of the most hazardous beaches in the Perth region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/48498caf-36fd-4cf3-a819-120b5c5f1b75" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A little wander along some of the beachside suburbs of Perth North of the River, checking out landmarks and historic spots.

It is protected by a 50 to 100m wide platform reef and except on days of big swell or onshore winds, is a safer  place for families and swimmers of all ages, as well as a good snorkelling spot.
The Mettam family had a holiday house at nearby Trigg, one of the first to be built on what would come to be called Mettam Street, and lived there for 34 years.  In the 1940's, Frank Mettam and his family patiently removed the reef that bisected what was then called Lennards Pool piece by piece, using nothing but muscle and grit, and a few pickaxes. Lennards Pool was renamed Mettams Pool and promoted as a safe ocean swimming pool for children and the elderly.

Before septic tanks were introduced in the 1940s a contractor for the Road Board buried rubbish and toilet waste at this site for the people who lived nearby.

These included many unfortunate people ‘on hard times’ who lived in a tent village south of North Beach Road during the Great Depression.

It is located 15 km north of Perth and comprises four hectares of semi-permanent freshwater lake with paperbark trees and 92 hectares of banksia, tuart, jarrah and marri woodlands, and areas of low heath.

Star Swamp provides a breeding site and sanctuary for both waterbirds and other bushland bird species with over 65 species of birds have been recorded. The bushland is also an important habitat for species of reptiles, insects, and spiders.

The main flowering period is between August and October, although there are plants in flower all year round. Over a dozen species of orchids occur in the bushland and several hundred flora species have been listed.

The Centaur was sunk after striking a reef (now called Centaur Reef) on 9 December 1874 while travelling from Champion Bay to Fremantle. All nine crew and four passengers, including noted politician and lawyer Septimus Burt, survived.
The 30 metre long brig, built in Aberdeen, Scotland in 1849, was carrying a cargo of 180 tonne of galena (lead ore) when it struck the reef.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/48498caf-36fd-4cf3-a819-120b5c5f1b75" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A little wander along some of the beachside suburbs of Perth North of the River, checking out landmarks and historic spots.

The North Beach Watermans Bay area was subdivided into pastoral leases in 1869-70, with the bulk of the leases taken up by the Hamersley family.

Evidence of clearing is still visible on the swamps southern side. All that remains of the old orchard is the large olive tree which you passed on your way in.

Star Swamp was a frequent watering hole for cattle from Bettles Dairy which operated on Okely Road.

Story has it that the cattle led themselves to the swamp and back. Cattle grazed in this area until the dairy closed and the original pastoral leases were subdivided into residential lots.

As the Quenda is a species in decline, every effort is being made to protect it from threats and disturbances. These measures include Dieback quarantine, animal pest control, weed management, revegetation and protective fencing. 

If you visit this area early morning or late afternoon, keep your eyes peeled and noise to a minimum and you may be lucky enough to spot one or two of these shy little creatures.

During the Second World War, a platoon of Australian Army 10th Light Horse Division was stationed at Mt Flora (Not Mt Floreat as stated on the sign) on coast watch duties.

The division used the swamp and a nearby well on Hope Street as frequent watering stations for their horses. 

The horses were once kept at a long-gone yard, which is now the intersection of Hope and Hale Streets.

It was originally called the Lion Mill Hotel, then the Mount Helena Hotel, before acquiring its current name. Locally it is referred to as The Mounties

In 2016 the Mount Helena Tavern was listed on Western Australia’s Heritage Register for the contribution made by the place to Western Australia’s social heritage.

MHI site 179 - The Mount Helena Tavern has very high aesthetic, social and historic significance for the Mount Helena community and the Shire of Mundaring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/5ed890c9-75a3-435c-b521-bf5e55a0aecf" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

We invite you to visit some local Heritage Listed establishments within the Mundaring LGA - this adventure should take between 1 - 2 hours.  The required information is able to be accessed 24/7.



Municipal Heritage Inventory -
It is mandatory under the Heritage of Western Australia Act 1990 for each local government
to maintain a Municipal Heritage Inventory (MHI). The Shire of Mundaring MHI lists many
places that contribute to the history and character of the local area and classifies them
according to the degree of significance. Modification of places on the MHI may not always
require planning approval, although sympathetic design is still recommended to maintain the
character and heritage values.

There is plenty of parking however can get busy on the weekends.

This is a great place to start our series.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/8228662f-9b6b-498f-ae3f-705b0234ef20" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Welcome to our Adventure Lab Cache designed by kids for kids!

We have always loved parks and playgrounds so we thought a perfect theme for our series would revolve around some in the Mundaring area.  

This series will only take about an hour to complete, depending if you can pry the kids away from the swings.

Each has plenty of parking, good phone reception and amenities close by.

Please Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Permission was finally granted.
164 years after it was sent to England Yagan's head was brought back to Australia for burial according to Nyoongah custom.
However due to the uncertainty of the whereabouts of the rest of the body, burial has not yet taken place.

In the early days of the settlement, Yagan was friendly with a number of the settlers. However, in1830, misunderstandings and tensions arose between the Nyoongah people and the new pioneers.
An incident concerning the shooting and death of a young Aboriginal boy who had entered a homestead near Melville caused a serious rift between the settlers and the local Aboriginal
community.

When the Keats pair found an opportunity Yagan and his brothers were shot and killed. Yagan's head was removed and placed in the wedge of a smoking tree in order to preserve it.
The head was eventually taken to England and was on display at the Royal Institute in Liverpool until 1964 when it was eventually buried in Everton cemetery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/a5ab75c8-83bd-4c13-bccb-2a752a4f2be4" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the Yagan memorial.

He initially worked in a gold mine near Gwalia (~233km north of Kalgoorlie) where he learnt to speak English. By 1925 he was working in Hotham felling trees before he took up dairy farming in Osborne Park. It was here that he met and married Ida. After 2-3 years he moved the cattle to Wanneroo where he leased the land for the dairy and subsequently purchased 500 acres. The dairy had about 100 heads of cattle but a TB outbreak reduced numbers by 20-30 over five years. 
Between 1931 - 1945 the site also operated as a second unofficial post office and telephone exchange.
The dairy was subsequently leased by a Mr Duffy before being purchased by Giovanni Gava in the 1950s.

Little of the dairy still exists with only a few cow pens and small shed still standing but the recent addition of a shared pathway makes accessibility to the site straightforward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/79813de7-ecfc-42a0-a886-bdf5617f2329" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Between 1834-41 explorers &amp; surveyors John Butler, George Grey, Thomas Watson &amp; John Septimus Roe visited the area now known as Wanneroo. The success of the Swan colony depended upon its ability to grow food so finding good arable land was vital. The first farms were set up around the shores of Lake Joondalup in the mid 1840s, with the Wesleyan Missionary Society setting up an experimental farm to be lived &amp; worked on by Aboriginal people under the guidance of the church. Running at a loss with poor soil, failed crops &amp; floods, the departure of overseer Frederick Waldeck led to the demise of the farm which then moved out to York.

In 1852 Wanneroo finally became home to its first permanent settlers James and Mary-Ann Cockman. This adventure cache explores some of Wanneroo's pioneering history.

The start of this Lab Cache points to the Wanneroo Museum which is usually open 10am to 4pm Monday to Friday, 12pm to 4pm Saturday and 11am to 3pm on Sundays.

Perth has a good collection of waterfalls within its hills, snuggled up against the scarp, some higher than others but all set in beautiful natural bushlands.
Pack a picnic, your hiking boots, walking poles and don't forget your camera. 

*Please note: all but one of these locations will require a short hike, sometimes over rough ground.*

Initially there was no club rooms so the members had to store the patrol equipment in their homes or garages. In 1960, the first clubrooms were built in front of the intersection of West Coast Drive and Padbury Circle to the south of the present clubrooms. It survived erosion during a major storm in 1962 but not the widening of West Coast Hwy. On 16 July 1969, a new set of clubrooms was built on the current site. In the late 70's, growing membership led to larger clubrooms being required. The clubrooms now comprise the old and the new building next to each other and were officially opened on 30th September 1978.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/1b3833c7-e4ba-4779-a7a1-798e221e747d" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This Adventure Lab is a tribute to all the volunteers who keep our beaches safe. It will take you to the Surf Life Saving Clubs between City Beach and Sorrento. It can be done in any order but the Bonus cache is at the Northern end of the Adventure Lab locations.

He came to the area during the Great Depression while fishing for a living with his brother Harry, and built a boatshed on the beach in 1930. Subsequently, he expanded it to accommodate himself, his wife and four children. For many years, they were the only residents of what is now Hillarys, and the nearest store, at North Beach to the south, was a 5 km walk away. During the Second World War, the Australian Army used the area, and named it "Hillary's Beach" on their maps. Bert Hillarys died in 1957 and the shack and 14 others nearby were destroyed in a fierce storm in 1964.

Historically, wind roses were predecessors of the compass rose (found on charts), as there was no differentiation between a cardinal direction and the wind which blew from such a direction. Using a polar coordinate system of gridding, the frequency of winds over a time period is plotted by wind direction, with color bands showing wind speed ranges. The direction of the longest spoke shows the wind direction with the greatest frequency.
Before the development of the compass rose, a wind rose was included on maps in order to let the reader know which directions the 8 major winds, 8 half-winds and 16 quarter-winds blew. No differentiation was made between cardinal directions and the winds which blew from those directions. North was depicted with a fleur de lis, while east was shown as a Christian cross to indicate the direction of Jerusalem from Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/5d4ea447-030f-4b64-8021-d67e3cddab1a" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hillarys was named after an early settler, Bertram John Hillary (1895-1957), who had become blind in his right eye while fighting in Gallipoli during the First World War.

He married Mary-Anne Roper (1812-1901) on 15th March 1830 in the first Anglican wedding in the colony. In 1852 they moved to the area to set up a 45 acre dairy farm and market garden at the edge of Walluburnup Swamp.

The building we see today is their second home built approx 1860 by James and his son John. The first house was a wattle and daub construction known as the little house. It was burnt down after becoming vermin infested. James and John quarried, by hand, the limestone from outcrops on the eastern side of the lake. The timber was prepared in one of the Shenton saw mills.

James and Mary had 7 children and 4 generations lived here until it was purchased and restored by the City of Wanneroo in 1988.

The house is normally open Sundays 2pm-5pm (closed February) but you do not need to enter to answer the question.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/79813de7-ecfc-42a0-a886-bdf5617f2329" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Between 1834-41 explorers &amp; surveyors John Butler, George Grey, Thomas Watson &amp; John Septimus Roe visited the area now known as Wanneroo. The success of the Swan colony depended upon its ability to grow food so finding good arable land was vital. The first farms were set up around the shores of Lake Joondalup in the mid 1840s, with the Wesleyan Missionary Society setting up an experimental farm to be lived &amp; worked on by Aboriginal people under the guidance of the church. Running at a loss with poor soil, failed crops &amp; floods, the departure of overseer Frederick Waldeck led to the demise of the farm which then moved out to York.

In 1852 Wanneroo finally became home to its first permanent settlers James and Mary-Ann Cockman. This adventure cache explores some of Wanneroo's pioneering history.

The start of this Lab Cache points to the Wanneroo Museum which is usually open 10am to 4pm Monday to Friday, 12pm to 4pm Saturday and 11am to 3pm on Sundays.

It is a tree with rough, fibrous bark, leaves with a distinct midvein, white flowers and relatively large, more or less spherical fruit. Its hard, dense timber is insect resistant although the tree is susceptible to dieback. The timber has been utilised for cabinet-making, flooring and railway sleepers.

Jarrah is a tree which sometimes grows to a height of 40 m (100 ft) high with a trunk up to 3 m (10 ft) in diameter.

The town is only an hour south of Perth and thirty minutes from Armadale or Rockingham.
HISTORICALLY 
In 1871, the Rockingham Jarrah Company was granted a lease of 250,000 acres of jarrah forest in the Darling Range. In 1872, the company built a sawmill in Jarrahdale, a jetty at Rockingham for loading the timber onto ships for export, and a railway line to connect them. The Jarrahdale to Rockingham train line was the second rail line in the colony and initially had wooden rails and a locomotive that averaged 20km/hour. The wooden rails were replaced with iron from 1878 - 1882, and they lasted till 1950. Jarrahdale was  the state's first major timber milling operation, and it played a key role in the development of W.A. through the exportation of jarrah around the world. In 1872, 8220 people lived in Perth, and over 300 lived and worked in Jarrahdale. Between 1893 and 1899.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

An on the water shopping precint has been built which has many locations to shop, wine &amp; dine. A small beach is still used by families today. Other attractions in and around the harbour include helicopter flights, fishing charters &amp; cruises. A ferry also departs from here to Rottnest Island daily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/5d4ea447-030f-4b64-8021-d67e3cddab1a" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hillarys was named after an early settler, Bertram John Hillary (1895-1957), who had become blind in his right eye while fighting in Gallipoli during the First World War. He came to the area during the Great Depression while fishing for a living with his brother Harry, and built a boatshed on the beach in 1930. Subsequently, he expanded it to accommodate himself, his wife and four children. For many years, they were the only residents of what is now Hillarys, and the nearest store, at North Beach to the south, was a 5 km walk away. During the Second World War, the Australian Army used the area, and named it "Hillary's Beach" on their maps. Bert Hillarys died in 1957 and the shack and 14 others nearby were destroyed in a fierce storm in 1964.

HISTORICALLY 
In 1871, the Rockingham Jarrah Company was granted a lease of 250,000 acres of jarrah forest in the Darling Range. In 1872, the company built a sawmill in Jarrahdale, a jetty at Rockingham for loading the timber onto ships for export, and a railway line to connect them. The Jarrahdale to Rockingham train line was the second rail line in the colony and initially had wooden rails and a locomotive that averaged 20km/hour. The wooden rails were replaced with iron from 1878 - 1882, and they lasted till 1950. Jarrahdale was  the state's first major timber milling operation, and it played a key role in the development of W.A. through the exportation of jarrah around the world. In 1872, 8220 people lived in Perth, and over 300 lived and worked in Jarrahdale. Between 1893 and 1899.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

It is replete with restaurants, cafe, shops, a night club, aquatic activities, plus hordes of boats ready to go to sea. At the outer entrance to the marina you will find this lighthouse. It can be reached by land along an artificial mole. The top of the lighthouse is not accessible to the public, but there is a lookout platform approximately 5m above ground level. The lighthouse is 24m high. According to an information plaque (included in the gallery), the lantern of this lighthouse was originally installed in a lighthouse in northern Western Australia a century ago. It now serves to guide pleasure boat captains home.

The Perry family operated a horse breaking and stock dealing business here from 1912 to 1929.

Between 1915 and 1930, Wanneroo Picnic Race Days were held here annually. This community event was one of the highlights of the year and consisted of foot races in the morning and horse racing in the afternoon. Lunch was served under the shade of the large trees to the north. The last race day occurred in 1930 after which the WA Turf Club refused permission for racing and betting at Perry's Paddock.

From the 1930s the paddock was used as a market garden by the Hastings and then Duffy families.

Race days were re-introduced between 1992 and 2001.

Perry's cottage dates from around 1850 and was known as Linhay. The stables are reduced to a pile of rubble. The second building, the bunkhouse, was reconstructed in the 1990s but its origin is unknown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/79813de7-ecfc-42a0-a886-bdf5617f2329" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Between 1834-41 explorers &amp; surveyors John Butler, George Grey, Thomas Watson &amp; John Septimus Roe visited the area now known as Wanneroo. The success of the Swan colony depended upon its ability to grow food so finding good arable land was vital. The first farms were set up around the shores of Lake Joondalup in the mid 1840s, with the Wesleyan Missionary Society setting up an experimental farm to be lived &amp; worked on by Aboriginal people under the guidance of the church. Running at a loss with poor soil, failed crops &amp; floods, the departure of overseer Frederick Waldeck led to the demise of the farm which then moved out to York.

In 1852 Wanneroo finally became home to its first permanent settlers James and Mary-Ann Cockman. This adventure cache explores some of Wanneroo's pioneering history.

The start of this Lab Cache points to the Wanneroo Museum which is usually open 10am to 4pm Monday to Friday, 12pm to 4pm Saturday and 11am to 3pm on Sundays.

The town is only an hour south of Perth and thirty minutes from Armadale or Rockingham.
HISTORICALLY 
In 1871, the Rockingham Jarrah Company was granted a lease of 250,000 acres of jarrah forest in the Darling Range. In 1872, the company built a sawmill in Jarrahdale, a jetty at Rockingham for loading the timber onto ships for export, and a railway line to connect them. The Jarrahdale to Rockingham train line was the second rail line in the colony and initially had wooden rails and a locomotive that averaged 20km/hour. The wooden rails were replaced with iron from 1878 - 1882, and they lasted till 1950. Jarrahdale was  the state's first major timber milling operation, and it played a key role in the development of W.A. through the exportation of jarrah around the world. In 1872, 8220 people lived in Perth, and over 300 lived and worked in Jarrahdale. Between 1893 and 1899.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

No need to go beyond the gates but it would be a pity to come all this way and not venture further.
Millbrook is a boutique winery and restaurant in the historic town of Jarrahdale in Western Australia, 50 minutes south-east of Perth. The winery is located at the picturesque Chestnut Farm, a property that backs on to the Serpentine River and is nestled among jarrah forests, with stunning vistas of the rolling landscape.

The origins of Chestnut Farm date back to the 19th century, when the original owner, Joseph Batt, planted an orchard and the first grapevines in 1865, providing fruit to the local timber-millers in Jarrahdale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/5f5ebda9-0d65-4e22-ba61-6bcbb26516e4" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If discovering quality, unique craft beers and wine is at the top of your geocaching 'to do' list, the Peel Region Craft Beer and Wine Trail makes it easy for you. We have included five of the locations in this Adventure. The trail provides an authentically local experience, to be enjoyed at your own pace. You will need to hop into the geomobile and go for a drive through some attractive countryside in the Peel Region. You do not have to enter the establishment......but then again.....Why not?

The town is only an hour south of Perth and thirty minutes from Armadale or Rockingham.
HISTORICALLY 
In 1871, the Rockingham Jarrah Company was granted a lease of 250,000 acres of jarrah forest in the Darling Range. In 1872, the company built a sawmill in Jarrahdale, a jetty at Rockingham for loading the timber onto ships for export, and a railway line to connect them. The Jarrahdale to Rockingham train line was the second rail line in the colony and initially had wooden rails and a locomotive that averaged 20km/hour. The wooden rails were replaced with iron from 1878 - 1882, and they lasted till 1950. Jarrahdale was  the state's first major timber milling operation, and it played a key role in the development of W.A. through the exportation of jarrah around the world. In 1872, 8220 people lived in Perth, and over 300 lived and worked in Jarrahdale. Between 1893 and 1899.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

It is the largest reservoir constructed on the Eastern Railway line and supplied water to steam trains for almost 50 years. Since 1949 it has been used as a recreation area for both locals, interstate and overseas visitors. Many locals learned to swim at the Lake, especially before the 1960s when there were no public swimming pools available locally. 

In 2005, Lake Leschenaultia gained a heritage listing based on the railway history, recreational significance and other factors. In 2006, the 40m timber jetty (constructed in 1971) was removed due to safety issues and has since been replaced with a pontoon.

The name "Leschenaultia" comes from the lake colour's resemblance to the Blue Leschenaultia flower.

It was also an important stop for watering of the trains from the well and the huge water towers in the station.  These demands on Chidlow's Well led to Lake Leschenaultia being created in 1898 as a railway reservoir, where water was pumped by steam-powered pumps into the station yard water towers. The railway made the forest area more accessible and by 1898 there more than 14 licensed sleeper cutters working from the Chidlow area.  

Many of the sleepers from Chidlow were used in goldfields railways and mine shafts.  Orchardists were the next generation of workers to populate the area as the soil was found to be extremely productive.  

Chidlow was a major factor in the rapid growth of fruit exports from WA between 1907 – 1914, and the success of the fruit growing industry reflected in the growth of the township after the turn of the century.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/42fd9276-62a9-4347-b77e-082b8ff999d6" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having just moved back to WA and being located in the Chidlow area, I thought what better than to show off some of the local features and sites of this great little town.

It sits right on the footpath in Thomas Street Chidlow, opposite the Railway Reserve Heritage Trail where Chidlow's Wells Station once stood. The building is single-storey brick, with simple timber detailing to the front veranda, doors and windows. The roof is of corrugated iron with a hipped form that continues down to form the veranda without any break in pitch. Projecting rooms to the front and side also have hipped roofs extending out from the main roof structure. The main entry into the hotel is from a door on the veranda with stained glass panels and sidelights.

The Chidlow townsite was originally named Chidlow's Well after a small waterhole near the old Northam road. The watering place had been known to travellers for many years and was named after a pioneer family of Northam. Settlement began in 1883 when it became known that Chidlow's Well was to be the terminus of the second section of the Eastern Railway. The railway station and townsite were changed from Chidlow's well to Chidlow in 1920.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/42fd9276-62a9-4347-b77e-082b8ff999d6" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having just moved back to WA and being located in the Chidlow area, I thought what better than to show off some of the local features and sites of this great little town.

You will see them in various stages here.

Tuarts grow up to 40 metres high. Its rough, fibrous grey bark flakes into small pieces. The leaves are often curved, 90 to 160 millimetres long, and are a shiny light green above and paler below. The almost stalkless buds cluster in groups of seven. Tuart buds are very distinctive; they have swollen bud caps and are shaped like small ice cream cones. Each bud cap is eight to 10 millimetres long and the species name refers to this feature - ‘gompho’ (club) and ‘cephala’ (head). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/604a7b92-e3c2-46b2-b593-9bcb4266a413" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Take a short stroll from the Baldivis Dog Park, and down along the creek.

I think the biological name on the plaque is the coolest thing and I recon an early option of "doyathinkisaurus" was laughed out so they compromised with "Underwoodisaurus" and tried to pass it off as being named after British herpetologist, Garth Leon Underwood.

While you are reading the plaque, you will need some information off it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/604a7b92-e3c2-46b2-b593-9bcb4266a413" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Take a short stroll from the Baldivis Dog Park, and down along the creek.
There are some interesting artworks along this short adventure lab series.
Park at the dog park, start your wander, then turn around and come back to give your 4 legged friends a real run.

At each location, there will be a clue once you answer the question. Grab the 5 letters (one in each answer), which will reveal a key word. You will need this keyword for a nearby mystery cache.

Point Peron holds great significance for the Whadjuk people, the traditional owners of the area, whose family groups would travel through the region utilising seasonal resources.  It is still a special place for them to preserve their Aboriginal ties and traditions.

Point Peron was named after French Zoologist and Naturalist, François Péron who accompanied Commodore Nicholas Baudin on his expedition along the western coast of Australia in 1801.
From 1942-1945 (during WWII) Point Peron was the site of the "K" Battery complex .  This battery complex was one of a chain of coastal gun placements defending the Perth region from Swanbourne, in the north to Cape Peron in the south.

The area is well known for its protected beaches, limestone cliffs, great snorkelling, diving, fishing and scenic views.  

We hope you enjoy this Adventure Lab along this beautiful coastline.

Two Coastal Artillery Searchlight (CASLs) were established once the Peron Battery was commissioned.  They were controlled by a Director Electric Control which enabled them to be operated from John Point and Mushroom Rock.  Whilst dark the searchlights were manned from dawn to dusk and were the Battery's 'eyes'.
An anti-submarine boom fence began construction in 1943 as a part of the strategy to prevent passage of enemy ships or midget submarines.  This was also constructed across the southern entrances in the approximate area where the Causeway Bridge now links Point Peron to Garden Island.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/72fff342-9c75-423e-8579-8fec3b1e60b5" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Cape Peron, or as we know it locally, Point Peron.

You can choose from one of three walks in the area. A short paved trail will take you from the carpark to the falls, but if you have the time, the Baldwin’s Bluff is highly recommended. It is quite a steep track, but that being said, it is a beautiful hike and worth it for the stunning views over the falls at the end. 
Serpentine is the only one on this list with an entry fee, but it is definitely worth it for the sights and well maintained facilities including toilets and a barbecue area to make the trip worthwhile.
*No dogs (or other pets) allowed.*

Distance: 100m (car park walk) to 6km return (Baldwin’s Bluff)
Recommended for: All&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/38a3bbf1-4aa8-494d-97b9-f8694299312b" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’ve found yourself a clear day after a heavy downpour, the best thing you can do is hop in your car and get yourself to one of these waterfall hikes as soon as possible! Perth has a good collection of waterfalls within its hills, snuggled up against the scarp, some higher than others but all set in beautiful natural bushlands.
Pack a picnic, your hiking boots, walking poles and don't forget your camera. 

*Please note: all but one of these locations will require a short hike, sometimes over rough ground.*

A roadblock only allows one team member to complete the task. Here the contestants found a barrel full of flags on the beach and had to arrange them in the order of the countries that they had visited on the race.

Since then there has been development and refurbishment occurring around the point. A replica cannon has been erected at one of the former battery positions on the point, make your way there to complete your final challenge before the finish line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/59ba51eb-26ca-4ea3-b29a-9d8f9fb679a9" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Amazing Race is a reality television program that started in the US in 2001.

It sees teams race against each other around the world, completing challenges along the way to get the next piece of information needed to continue on the race.

The first season of The Amazing Race Australia was in 2011. It saw 11 teams race around the world going to 10 countries and covering over 50 000km. The series culminated in the final three teams racing around Perth completing challenges attempting to arrive at the check-in point first and claim a $250 000 prize.

In this recreation of the final leg you will have to make your way along the same route that the teams did to claim your final prize, not cash but a cache (GC9G7E2).&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Point Peron was once an integral part of the coastal defence or Western Australia during WWII.  Once the Japanese attacked Darwin Harbour there was an urgent need to strengthen the defences of Australia.  This battery was last in one of a string of heavy coastal batteries up to Swanbourne which also included Garden and Rottnest Islands.  Thankfully none of this artillery was used in battle.  The battery was decommissioned in December 1944.

Point Peron holds great significance for the Whadjuk people, the traditional owners of the area, whose family groups would travel through the region utilising seasonal resources.  It is still a special place for them to preserve their Aboriginal ties and traditions.

Point Peron was named after French Zoologist and Naturalist, François Péron who accompanied Commodore Nicholas Baudin on his expedition along the western coast of Australia in 1801.
From 1942-1945 (during WWII) Point Peron was the site of the "K" Battery complex .  This battery complex was one of a chain of coastal gun placements defending the Perth region from Swanbourne, in the north to Cape Peron in the south.

The area is well known for its protected beaches, limestone cliffs, great snorkelling, diving, fishing and scenic views.  

We hope you enjoy this Adventure Lab along this beautiful coastline.

Bert arrived in Australia in 1911 and originally settled in Cranbrook and worked as a shearer for Synott and Dunbar, later becoming a dairy farmer in Wanneroo. After returning to Italy and marrying Maria Pollette, he returned to WA. They had 4 children - Erica, Zelia, Frank and Alex.

Local history notes that he lived at Buckingham House and sometime between the 1940s and 50s they added windows to the south side of the property and the verandah.

Bert Togno park contains a path with wall of honour commemorating the settler families of Wanneroo which show many familiar names later attributed to roads, parks and suburbs in the Wanneroo surrounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/79813de7-ecfc-42a0-a886-bdf5617f2329" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Between 1834-41 explorers &amp; surveyors John Butler, George Grey, Thomas Watson &amp; John Septimus Roe visited the area now known as Wanneroo. The success of the Swan colony depended upon its ability to grow food so finding good arable land was vital. The first farms were set up around the shores of Lake Joondalup in the mid 1840s, with the Wesleyan Missionary Society setting up an experimental farm to be lived &amp; worked on by Aboriginal people under the guidance of the church. Running at a loss with poor soil, failed crops &amp; floods, the departure of overseer Frederick Waldeck led to the demise of the farm which then moved out to York.

In 1852 Wanneroo finally became home to its first permanent settlers James and Mary-Ann Cockman. This adventure cache explores some of Wanneroo's pioneering history.

The start of this Lab Cache points to the Wanneroo Museum which is usually open 10am to 4pm Monday to Friday, 12pm to 4pm Saturday and 11am to 3pm on Sundays.

In the early days of the Swan River Colony, the district of Wanneroo represented an "outer" region and it is not until 1834, that an excursion into the area by any explorers or settlers is recorded. In that year, a party of four led by John Butler, travelled about 35 miles north from Perth to search for lost cattle and passed through the area just to the east of Lake Joondalup. Butler stated that the aborigines of the area were "those wanneroo men who frequent Perth in company with the Yellowgonga tribe." It is not known when early settlers started using the name "Wanneroo", but, as early as 1842, a Surveyor recorded "road to Wanneroo" and in 1844, James Dobbins gave his address as Wanneroo. A government townsite was gazetted as "Wanneru", an Aboriginal word referring to the sticks used by women for digging roots, in August 1907 and it was not until May 1953 that the spelling was amended to "Wanneroo".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/02bfc544-156d-4cad-a499-2bcc61ab7736" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the West Oz Geocaching Road Trip adventure taking you to some interesting locations in Western Australia.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

This adventure will take you to some of these murals and talk about the stories of how they have been developed.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

A visit to Karakamia Wildlife Sanctuary is like going back in time to experience the bush as it was 200 years ago, before the arrival of feral animals.  The sanctuary is 268 ha surrounded by a vermin-proof fence: feral animals have been eradicated providing a safe haven where many threatened mammals can now thrive.

Here you can observe critically endangered mammals such as Woylies and Western Ringtail Possums and also catch a glimpse of Quenda, and Tammar Wallabies, foraging together on the forest floor under towering Jarrah and Marri trees. Listen to the Red-tailed Black Cockatoos chortle in chorus as the sun goes down, then try to catch a glimpse of tiny microbats darting and dashing along the bush tracks as they chase a tasty mosquito or other morsel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/42fd9276-62a9-4347-b77e-082b8ff999d6" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having just moved back to WA and being located in the Chidlow area, I thought what better than to show off some of the local features and sites of this great little town.

I have also added a Bonus Cache to find after finishing the adventure.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

John Buckingham arrived in the Swan River Colony in 1850 aboard "Sophia" with his wife and two children. John Buckingham Jnr married Emily Amelia Okley and had 5 children. He purchased 100 acres of land in 1876 around Lake Joondalup and built the house sometime in the 1880s. The house was leased by dairy farmers including William Tapping (1846-1935) and his wife Mary in 1899.  The Shire of Wanneroo purchased the house in 1975 and today it runs as a heritage education centre for local primary school children. 

Old Wanneroo Schoolroom - is a combination of two school rooms. Wanneroo school was originally located on the corner of Dundebar &amp; Wanneroo Rds. The larger section dates from 1899 and the smaller section was added in 1928 due to increased numbers of children at the East Wanneroo school (relocated from Jandabup). It has been moved 3 further times including in 1992 to Perry's Paddock as part of the city's collection of heritage buildings. In 2009 it was moved to the current location.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/79813de7-ecfc-42a0-a886-bdf5617f2329" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Between 1834-41 explorers &amp; surveyors John Butler, George Grey, Thomas Watson &amp; John Septimus Roe visited the area now known as Wanneroo. The success of the Swan colony depended upon its ability to grow food so finding good arable land was vital. The first farms were set up around the shores of Lake Joondalup in the mid 1840s, with the Wesleyan Missionary Society setting up an experimental farm to be lived &amp; worked on by Aboriginal people under the guidance of the church. Running at a loss with poor soil, failed crops &amp; floods, the departure of overseer Frederick Waldeck led to the demise of the farm which then moved out to York.

In 1852 Wanneroo finally became home to its first permanent settlers James and Mary-Ann Cockman. This adventure cache explores some of Wanneroo's pioneering history.

The start of this Lab Cache points to the Wanneroo Museum which is usually open 10am to 4pm Monday to Friday, 12pm to 4pm Saturday and 11am to 3pm on Sundays.

The life-size figure was originally modelled in clay before being cast in bronze, the whole process taking around 12 months.

'The Graduate' was created by father and son duo Tony Jones and Ben Jones, who, individually and together are the artists responsible for some of WA's interesting and iconic public art, the most notable being the bronze sculpture 'Eliza' in the Swan River.  Others include the bronze sculpture life guards at Scarborough beach, and C. Y. O'Connor and his horse in the surf at Coogee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/8e099d6f-908b-4eaa-a996-33ee351892e8" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This art trail explores some of the early public art installed in Joondalup when the suburb was being developed.  Most of the art has been specifically commissioned by the City of Joondalup, but many of the institutions in the area have also installed public art worth visiting.

If you have time, a walk or cycle is the best way to explore the area.  You could visit the locations in either a clockwise or anticlockwise direction, and enjoy the art, scenery and bushland on the way.

Tickets can be bought online https://www.penguinisland.com.au/ or by visiting the booking kiosk. Depending on the tide, some locals like to walk across the exposed sandbar to the island. While you might avoid the ferry and park fees this way, it can be extremely dangerous with steep drop offs and quick-changing conditions. Walking the sandbar is --not recommended--. People have come to unfortunate ends doing so. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/162d10de-e12d-41ef-b117-3f138b8d85f1" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Located in the Shoalwater Islands Marine Park, Penguin Island is home to colonies of pelicans, terns, gulls, and of course Little Penguins. Over the years, the penguin population has been hit hard by human activity such as hunting, as well as introduced animals such as dogs and rabbits, and only a few hundred now remain. Today, Penguin Island's penguins are protected from these threats by the park's rules, appropriate facilities, and conservation work. However, they are still under threat from the broader problems of climate change and habitat damage, as well as human activity such as fishing and boating. To complete this AL, you will be heading to the island on the ferry. The ferry prices and park fees can be found at https://www.penguinisland.com.au/&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Located on a vast corner block, the building's modern glass, steel and wood stylings hold a small bar area within the brewhouse. The alfresco deck looks across a large lawn – typically filled with families on the weekends – to Lake Walyungup, the inspiration for the brewery’s name and artwork.
Despite the saline appearance of the protected wetlands, the "white lakes" are actually fresh water, with the illusion the result of a limestone cap beginning at the lakes and running south more than 200 kilometres to Yallingup. It’s a vista that provides a unique backdrop – often complete with stunning sunsets &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/5f5ebda9-0d65-4e22-ba61-6bcbb26516e4" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If discovering quality, unique craft beers and wine is at the top of your geocaching 'to do' list, the Peel Region Craft Beer and Wine Trail makes it easy for you. We have included five of the locations in this Adventure. The trail provides an authentically local experience, to be enjoyed at your own pace. You will need to hop into the geomobile and go for a drive through some attractive countryside in the Peel Region. You do not have to enter the establishment......but then again.....Why not?

In Western Australia, Kevin Draper was selected to work from the Transfield workshops at Garden Island to create the artwork.

Wanneroo – Joondalup Returned and Services, and the 10 metre high memorial and bronze statue here was unveiled on ANZAC day in 1996.

The top of the memorial is a semi-circular window through which the rising sun shines.  It is inscribed with the words, ‘Those only deserve freedom who are prepared to defend it’. The sculptors describe the boy with the poppy as "a symbol of the innocence of children and the desire for world peace".

Originally from Ireland, Smith Sculptors are a husband and wife team who, along with their daughter, specialise in large public art projects in Western Australia, Australia, and internationally. The team is responsible for some of the iconic memorials and public art in WA, such as the Kangaroos on St Georges Terrace, Percy Button (the street entertainer doing a handstand) in the Hay Street Mall, and the HMAS Sydney memorial in Geraldton.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/8e099d6f-908b-4eaa-a996-33ee351892e8" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This art trail explores some of the early public art installed in Joondalup when the suburb was being developed.  Most of the art has been specifically commissioned by the City of Joondalup, but many of the institutions in the area have also installed public art worth visiting.

If you have time, a walk or cycle is the best way to explore the area.  You could visit the locations in either a clockwise or anticlockwise direction, and enjoy the art, scenery and bushland on the way.

You will find the plaques incorporated in the columns along the Joondalup Library and Civic Centre underpass.

Each pair of plaques can be found installed opposite each other.  All but one pair is the positive and negative cast of each other, which represent early domestic life in the Joondalup area.

Steve Tepper has many other public art installations all around Perth, a favourite of which is the octopus at Heathcote playground. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/8e099d6f-908b-4eaa-a996-33ee351892e8" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This art trail explores some of the early public art installed in Joondalup when the suburb was being developed.

Jerry the penguin was rescued 25 years ago. After being blinded in one eye by a fishing hook, she wouldn't have survived in the wild.

Given it’s smaller size and location, it’s one of the first waterfalls to begin filling up with the rains, making it a popular early-winter day trip spot. The surrounding walk trail is pleasant, easily accessible, and dog-friendly! There are  picnic tables and toilet facilities. 

Distance: 3.5km
Recommended for: Everyone&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/38a3bbf1-4aa8-494d-97b9-f8694299312b" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’ve found yourself a clear day after a heavy downpour, the best thing you can do is hop in your car and get yourself to one of these waterfall hikes as soon as possible! Perth has a good collection of waterfalls within its hills, snuggled up against the scarp, some higher than others but all set in beautiful natural bushlands.
Pack a picnic, your hiking boots, walking poles and don't forget your camera. 

*Please note: all but one of these locations will require a short hike, sometimes over rough ground.*

This adventure will take you up to the water tower at the top of the hill and back down to explore some of the area's interesting features. 

You will be able to follow footpaths for most of the way and the slopes are not overly challenging. But if you decide to walk the whole way, you might want to bring some water.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

In this area you will find the main tourist information office and 4 large information boards along the edge of the quay. These detail just a few of the many activities to be enjoyed on Rotto, and provide maps of the island and the main settlement. With so much to see &amp; do (and so little time!) it can be helpful to plan your visit to gain maximum enjoyment.

You will quickly realise that the pace of life is a little slower over here - helped in part by the fact the only road traffic allowed is a small fleet of essential vehicles. There are no private cars on the island. The majority of visitors to Rotto hire a bicycle (or bring their own over with them) - the bike hire facility on Rottnest is the largest in the southern hemisphere!

Also here you will find an interactive Welcome to Country greeting from an Elder of the local Aboriginal people and the traditional owners of the land on which you stand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/6be0f959-3fcc-482b-823b-da42db56d643" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Situated 18kms offshore in the sparkling Indian Ocean, Rottnest Island is Perth's playground - with over 500,000 visitors each year coming to enjoy this A Class protected reserve.

Known as Wadjemup to the local Nyoongar people, 'Rotto' is absolutely packed with incredible experiences, breathtaking scenery, fantastic beaches, amazing wildlife and a huge array of things to see &amp; do. Whether you flew here, sailed over, caught a ferry or even swam here (yes, people do!), you'll quickly discover why Rotto is much-loved by locals and visitors alike.

It's a destination like no other. This Adventure will highlight a few locations to compliment your visit and can easily be completed on foot during a day trip - giving you heaps of time to explore and enjoy the rest of the island!

Note: All visitors are required to pay an admission fee to the island (Government levy to help fund conservation). Accordingly, this Adventure has been approved for publication by Geocaching HQ.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Various facilities are located here to keep you happy &amp; safe, including places to eat &amp; drink, shop, essential services (fire, police &amp; medical), a variety of holiday accomodation units and holiday fun for all the family (fun park, playgrounds, mini golf, even a cinema). It is also the start / end point for many of the island tours (fees payable).

The Settlement is also one of the places you are guaranteed to see Rottnest's most famous resident - the quokka. Famed for always looking happy, this little marsupial (similar to kangaroos and wallabies), can be seen hopping all over the island. And with no natural predators it's estimated there are between 12,000 &amp; 15,000 of them!

The quokka is also how Rottnest got its name: early Dutch explorers mistook them for giant rats and named the island Rotte Nest (meaning rat's nest).

An information board nearby provides some details of the history behind the main shopping area and its origins as a stable yard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/6be0f959-3fcc-482b-823b-da42db56d643" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Situated 18kms offshore in the sparkling Indian Ocean, Rottnest Island is Perth's playground - with over 500,000 visitors each year coming to enjoy this A Class protected reserve.

There are also extensive military buildings and infrastructure including Kingstown Barracks &amp; parade ground (operational until 1984) and the Oliver Hill gun battery (WWII fortifications).

And while Rottnest today is a place of joyful memories, sadly that has not always been the case. Established in 1839 as a British penal facility, around 4000 Aboriginal prisoners were incarcerated on the island with around 370 dying during captivity. The island was also used as an internment camp in both WWI and WWII, and more recently was a secure quarantine facility for Covid-19.

This grassed area is Heritage Common where you will find a number of heritage buildings and information boards. Please take the time to reflect on the past.

Also located here is Lomas Cottage, now an exhibition space. An information board is outside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/6be0f959-3fcc-482b-823b-da42db56d643" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Situated 18kms offshore in the sparkling Indian Ocean, Rottnest Island is Perth's playground - with over 500,000 visitors each year coming to enjoy this A Class protected reserve.

Recognising that one lighthouse in the centre of the island was insufficient, this additional lighthouse was constructed at half the height of the main lighthouse at Wadjemup Hill, and provides an additional reference point for seafarers navigating into Fremantle.

Offering fantastic views across the iconic Pinky Beach the lighthouse beam is visible for 14 nautical miles. Bathurst Lighthouse is closed to the public, however guided tours are available at Wadjemup Lighthouse. With a number of wrecks around the coastal waters and its limestone reef terrain, Rottnest offers world-class diving opportunities. In fact, one such event led directly to the first known European to land on Rottnest: Abraham Leeman in 1658. 

The commemorative Leeman Monument is nearby.

Note: the beach stage can be reached via the signed 'Eagle' coastal path along Pinky Beach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/6be0f959-3fcc-482b-823b-da42db56d643" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Situated 18kms offshore in the sparkling Indian Ocean, Rottnest Island is Perth's playground - with over 500,000 visitors each year coming to enjoy this A Class protected reserve.

With incredible scenery at every turn, Rottnest boasts some of the finest beaches in the world.

One which regularly tops traveller recommendation lists is The Basin, famed for its crystal clear shallow waters and fantastic snorkelling. Situated only a 10 minute walk from the main settlement, The Basin's pristine waters offer a safe environment for the whole family.

With swimming, surfing, fishing, snorkelling, diving and boating opportunities all around the island this A Class Reserve provides a magical marine environment.

When enjoying the beaches please stay safe and remember the beach code:

Take nothing but photographs
Keep nothing but memories
Leave nothing but footprints

Looking out over the beach is the Willem de Vlamingh Commemorative Plaque.

Note: the lighthouse stage can be reached via the signed 'Eagle' coastal path along the beach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/6be0f959-3fcc-482b-823b-da42db56d643" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Situated 18kms offshore in the sparkling Indian Ocean, Rottnest Island is Perth's playground - with over 500,000 visitors each year coming to enjoy this A Class protected reserve.

Known as Wadjemup to the local Nyoongar people, 'Rotto' is absolutely packed with incredible experiences, breathtaking scenery, fantastic beaches, amazing wildlife and a huge array of things to see &amp; do. Whether you flew here, sailed over, caught a ferry or even swam here (yes, people do!), you'll quickly discover why Rotto is much-loved by locals and visitors alike.

It's a destination like no other. This Adventure will highlight a few locations to compliment your visit and can easily be completed on foot during a day trip - giving you heaps of time to explore and enjoy the rest of the island!

Note: All visitors are required to pay an admission fee to the island (Government levy to help fund conservation). Accordingly, this Adventure has been approved for publication by Geocaching HQ.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

If you look back towards the sports fields that is down the hill a little way. The only remains are a few fence posts and a broken gate. When we first visited this site about 7 years ago there were information boards giving the history of the site but they have disappeared too. I am currently researching it and will update this page when I am able.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/22ef9791-6c1e-4af1-b457-febcac1c1ff0" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have enjoyed all of the adventure Lab Caches that we have tried so far but must admit that we did most of them by car or public transport. With the festive season over it has been decided that I need a little more exercise! So this one is designed to take you on a walk or bike ride, starting and finishing in Larkhill Sports Complex and meandering on bush walks up to the Old Homestead which boasts a panoramic view of the whole complex.
Venture to the boardwalks for amazing viewing of nature such as the 600+ year old grass trees. The viewing platforms will highlight other special features of interest. Make time to stop and read the nature signage along the trails that highlight and explain the flora and fauna of the area. The wetland is a Federally recognised Threatened Ecological Community (TEC).

The Southern Brown Bandicoot or Quenda is one of WA's most endearing mammals. Often not much bigger than a brown rat, they can grow as big as rabbits. They only inhabit areas with dense vegetation so this area should be ideal for them but unfortunately, as they are nocturnal you probably will not catch sight of them, unless of course you are one of those intrepid night cachers!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/22ef9791-6c1e-4af1-b457-febcac1c1ff0" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have enjoyed all of the adventure Lab Caches that we have tried so far but must admit that we did most of them by car or public transport.

There is also a synthetic field hockey pitch. The complex has lighting suitable for hosting night time events on all sporting fields, multiple changing room facilities, and grandstands for spectator sports events.

It was one of the home grounds for the Perth Spirit team in the National Rugby Championship in 2014
Nearby you will find a pergola with BBQ facilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/22ef9791-6c1e-4af1-b457-febcac1c1ff0" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have enjoyed all of the adventure Lab Caches that we have tried so far but must admit that we did most of them by car or public transport. With the festive season over it has been decided that I need a little more exercise! So this one is designed to take you on a walk or bike ride, starting and finishing in Larkhill Sports Complex and meandering on bush walks up to the Old Homestead which boasts a panoramic view of the whole complex.
Venture to the boardwalks for amazing viewing of nature such as the 600+ year old grass trees. The viewing platforms will highlight other special features of interest. Make time to stop and read the nature signage along the trails that highlight and explain the flora and fauna of the area. The wetland is a Federally recognised Threatened Ecological Community (TEC).

The first burials were recorded in 1915.  It was the only one in Western Australia established specifically to serve the nearby hospital.

The cemetery contains graves of people from many parts of Western Australia who were brought to the Wooroloo Sanitarium on account of their illness and in particular tuberculosis between 1915 and 1970. The names found in Wooroloo Cemetery are quite broad in their ethnic mix, such as English, Irish, Scottish, German, Yugoslavian, Chinese, Japanese and Aboriginal.

There are up to two thousand persons interred in the cemetery. While many graves relate to the patients at the sanatorium, other graves are linked to returned servicemen. 
The majority of the graves associated with the Sanatorium are mounds identified simply by a cast iron marker bearing the plot number as most were far from family and friends. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/d145caeb-98e9-4811-8d6d-8e37e1682ce8" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This Adventure Lab takes you on a short tour of some of the oldest and most interesting cemetery’s around East Perth and the Hills area's.  This Lab should take about 2 hours to complete and all sites should have good phone coverage. 

While you are visiting the various locations please take the opportunity to read a few of the headstones, finding about the area and the history of the people who are laid to rest there.  Sometimes it may give a hint as to what they did and where they originated from. 

Very importantly, please remember where you are and show the appropriate respect for the residents and people visiting them.

There is also an optional bonus mystery cache to find once you have finished.  You will need to collect the clues provided in the journals to solve the puzzle and get the cache coordinates.  

Good luck and have fun!

Known for their speciality Nebbiolo and Tempranillo wines but also produce Shiraz, Cabernet Sauvignon and Fortified Shiraz. The whiterange includes Chenin Blanc, Verdelho and Sparkling. The team believe that ‘quality wines begin in the vineyard’ and that their use of time intensive traditional methods enables meticulous care and expert craftsmanship to be infused into every bottle.

Art in the Vines events are held regularly in the grounds and cellar door tastings are open weekends and during the week by appointment.

In 1973 the first Shiraz vines were planted, followed by Chenin Blanc and Zinfandel in 1976, and Cabernet Sauvignon in 1979. Other varieties such as Chardonnay, Verdelho, Cabernet Franc and the traditional Portuguese Port Varieties were planted in 1980.

The Peel region with its close proximity to the Indian Ocean is the ideal location to grow wine grapes as it combines unique coastal limestone soils and a Mediterranean climate, ensuring wines with fruit intensity along with specific regional characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/5f5ebda9-0d65-4e22-ba61-6bcbb26516e4" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If discovering quality, unique craft beers and wine is at the top of your geocaching 'to do' list, the Peel Region Craft Beer and Wine Trail makes it easy for you.

You can see a man-made helping hand from this location but rest assured the Osprey are responsible for making it a home. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/1bf20d88-6171-4dfb-aa59-a47d56937de8" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this adventure lab is to get you out for a walk or bike ride along our stunning coastline. The series can be done in either direction with ample parking and watering holes at either end to aid the weary cacher! 

It is approximately 3km from one end to the other with a suggested route attached to the Bonus Box - GC8YQKG. This route keeps it fairly flat and gives you a nosey at the posh houses. NB There is a section of steps but there is a flat paved section to roll your bike up or down.

The questions are based around the movie "Clue" which is a 1985 American black comedy mystery film based on the board game of the same name.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/362d2dd5-0c2b-411e-b32f-ebf191890ae6" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Welcome to our new adventure with a different theme from the normal.

Are you up to it, collect the clues and solve the mystery of who killed John Doe?

It is located 40.7km to the north of Perth and was opened on Septermber 21st 2014.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/b725a41a-cce1-431d-909c-cab48dd07c51" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please be aware the locations for this Adventure Lab are quite a distance from the map marker, make sure you check your nearest Lab point before commencing.

The metropolitan Perth rail network is comprised of five major lines connecting the four Metropolitan Development Corridors and Fremantle to the Perth CBD.

Over the coming years the network is set to expand even further to accomade travelers from Ellenbrook, Forrestfield and extending lines past Armadale to Byford and continuing north to Yanchep.

This Adventure Lab will take you on a tour of the various lines of the Perth Rail Network. You are more than welcome to catch the trains to the stops (it can be done in a single day) if you wish but this is not a requirement, in fact all information can be gained and answered without entering the stations themselves.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

The design is representational of a fishing net, changing as it moves through the water. The Scoop is made up of five central posts or 'ribs', which are offset in an arched shape. It is constructed of marine grade aluminum, is approximately 10.5m high and sits within a 25 metre circular space within the roundabout. The whole structure is lit up at night, with the colours helping you to visualize the movement of the scoop through the water. It really is quite stunning to see!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/0918047e-dc18-4811-b483-7502cd0f9637" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This Adventure Lab cache is designed to get people out and about exploring Mandurah and the marine environment it has long been renowned for. The downtown tourist precinct seems to be forever evolving with new things to be discovered each time you wander around. Fortunately there are lots of places to stop, grab a bite to eat or something to drink before continuing on your way.

Please be prepared to spend a little bit of time on these ones with three of them having a fairly simple puzzle of some sort for you to solve. Hopefully, you will bring a pen and paper with you, your thinking caps and of course your cameras, for all the photo opportunities along the way.

A lot of talk about the wreck being haunted and the book is a fascinating read indeed.  Certainly some other great videos worth a look at if this history interests you, it certainly did me.  And I have very fond memories of 4 X 4 driving through the area back in the 1980's and 90's when the wreck was a lot lot more visible than it is today.

Hope you have enjoyed stage 1 of this Adventure Lab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/8c216064-ccd7-4b93-bb4c-d9523e5b22a4" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A meander from the Wreck of the Alkimos to Leeman's Landing in Two Rocks, with some scenic outlooks and plenty of spots of historical significance on the way. 

This can easily be completed within a day or you could rush and do it in a few hours, however I recommend you take your time and explore the area and take in some of Western Australia's early history.  Some parts might have you thinking about the early European passengers who thought they were heading to Batavia (Jakarta) but ended up being shipwrecked on what is now the beautiful northern beaches of Perth.

It is best completed from south to north, however it can be completed in any order you like, parking is readily available at all points or for the fitter geocachers a bicycle ride is quite doable.

Keep a close eye on your answers at each stage, because there might be a "Bonus Box" (GC8ANQJ) published.

It is located 70.1km from Perth and was opened on December 23rd 2007&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/b725a41a-cce1-431d-909c-cab48dd07c51" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please be aware the locations for this Adventure Lab are quite a distance from the map marker, make sure you check your nearest Lab point before commencing.

The metropolitan Perth rail network is comprised of five major lines connecting the four Metropolitan Development Corridors and Fremantle to the Perth CBD.

Over the coming years the network is set to expand even further to accomade travelers from Ellenbrook, Forrestfield and extending lines past Armadale to Byford and continuing north to Yanchep.

This Adventure Lab will take you on a tour of the various lines of the Perth Rail Network. You are more than welcome to catch the trains to the stops (it can be done in a single day) if you wish but this is not a requirement, in fact all information can be gained and answered without entering the stations themselves.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

The downtown tourist precinct seems to be forever evolving with new things to be discovered each time you wander around. Fortunately there are lots of places to stop, grab a bite to eat or something to drink before continuing on your way.

Please be prepared to spend a little bit of time on these ones with three of them having a fairly simple puzzle of some sort for you to solve. Hopefully, you will bring a pen and paper with you, your thinking caps and of course your cameras, for all the photo opportunities along the way.

His father (Winjan) and grandfather (Mogum) were leaders in the area. Yaburgurt was born  in Koolyininap (Halls Head) in 1824, a survivor of the Pinjarra Massacre he  became a significant  influential Noongar leader in the  region. Settlers gave him the name ‘George’ Winjan.

Yaburgurt saw much change and left a legacy that includes his wisdom, his knowledge of culture, his understanding and relationship of the land and the leadership of his people.  There is a  thread of cooperation and tolerance through his personal story as he found his way to work with the early colonising communities to great effect becoming one of the first Aboriginal people in the region to embrace reconciliation.

A hint for the next puzzle: you have in your hand the tool you need to solve it.

The downtown tourist precinct seems to be forever evolving with new things to be discovered each time you wander around. Fortunately there are lots of places to stop, grab a bite to eat or something to drink before continuing on your way.

Please be prepared to spend a little bit of time on these ones with three of them having a fairly simple puzzle of some sort for you to solve. Hopefully, you will bring a pen and paper with you, your thinking caps and of course your cameras, for all the photo opportunities along the way.

The pavement outside the Mandurah Visitor Centre on Mandurah Terrace boasts a remarkable depiction of the Peel-Harvey Estuary. Visit Mandurah commissioned Australia’s most highly awarded pavement artist, Jenny McCracken, to create this impressive 3D illusion for people to pose with.

If you stand at the spot from where the featured photo was taken, you can find the information you need to log this location's Adventure Lab cache.

PS Another of Jenny McCracken's artworks can be viewed and enjoyed at the Eastern End of the New Mandurah Traffic Bridge where the initial adventure lab icon is indicating, so you might like to go and check it out before leaving town.

In 1842 Peel turned a workman’s hit into a limestone chapel. In 1869 a fire burnt the village, hastening plans for a new church. Over 100 pounds was donated by settlers and 2 grants, each of £35 were made by the Perth diocese. Dorothy Anne Peel and her husband Henry Hastings Hall donated the land for the church. On 26 February the first service was held in the new church by Pinjarra Chaplain, Revd. James Steward Price. At this time the church had no pews or any plaster on the walls, but there was a pulpit donated by a church in Fremantle. The church was consecrated on the 25th of October 1871. This church is still in use today.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/94276232-3599-4262-a66f-87e112b844d9" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the Region of Peel. The Peel region is known for it’s beautiful waterways, dolphins, beaches, holidays blue manner crabs and canal lifestyles. Many don’t know about the history side come with me on a journey to visit a few of these sites. Most of the destinations are reached by driving and a small amount of walking. &lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

It is a place of reflection and rest where people of all nationalities and beliefs can mourn the loss of loved ones during conflict or war.
Water flowing through the monument and into the estuary echoes the lapping of the tide at Anzac Cove. The pillars rising from the water recreates the physical journey and emotional tension of the soldiers who courageously stormed the beaches, and rose from the trenches to face the conflict that confronted them.

***You’ll find the answer to the next question engraved on one of the four tallest pillars***

Designed for people of all ages and abilities, the new play space will be full of fun and activity year-round. It is a place for people to gather, celebrate and explore in the beauty of Mandurah’s Western Foreshore.

The play space design is inspired by Mandurah’s heritage, character and world-renowned natural environment. It connects the land and water by featuring elements from Mandurah’s iconic waterways including boating and estuary themed sculptural play.

This recreation precinct also includes a skate and activity space, 
large picnic tables, drinking fountains, a seating deck and new toilet facilities. 

With so much on offer here, I invite you to spend a little while exploring the area. Enjoy!

This canning factory was the second in operation and the largest in Mandurah. James Tuckey, with his wife and five children, sailed to the Victorian goldfields in the 1850’s and came back to Mandurah in 1862 with enough money to acquire land and purchase a small coastal vessel for trading. James’s son John jnr. and Charles became involved in the Northwest Pearling industry in the 1870s a profitable venture in which they became successful. Charles and John invested some of the pearling money into a new venture, C Tuckey &amp; Co Peel Inlet Preserving Works.
The migrant workers were housed in the barracks behind the cannery, the barracks were a long low rectangular building with shingle roof divided into six rooms. At its peak the preserving factory was producing 5000 cans of fish a day. The wall of the building is the only evidence of a sizeable Japanese community who lived in Mandurah for many years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/94276232-3599-4262-a66f-87e112b844d9" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the Region of Peel.

1830 in the beginning the area of land on which the Museum now stands was first occupied by Military built for soldiers. 
1852 The Mandurah Police barracks were built. 
1887 - 1889 Mrs C H Cooper rented the property followed by the Tuckey family. 
1894 The barracks were converted to a school and teachers quarters. 
1900 The entire barracks were converted to teachers quarters whilst new school was built. 
Many more organisations used these premises over the years. 
In 1989 the historical society was given permission to use the original schoolroom as a museum. 
2001 saw the City of Mandurah take over management of the museum. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/94276232-3599-4262-a66f-87e112b844d9" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the Region of Peel.

There is no record of the construction of the cottage, though it is likely that it was built with the assistance of the tradesmen and servants originally brought out on the Protector. The five roomed cottage is a perfect example of a pioneer home built entirely from local materials and represents an early European settlers cottage. 
Over the  years several families leased or lived in the house: 
Henry Edward Hall lived in the cottage, which he called “Dedallumup” until 1836. 
It was leased to Thomas Watson, an original pioneer- surveyor, the first mail contractor and ferry keeper. 
In 1843 John and Eleanor Sutton rented a small block of Henry E Halls property and occupied the cottage. John Sutton spent money on improvements to Halls Cottage.

The Peel region is known for it’s beautiful waterways, dolphins, beaches, holidays blue manner crabs and canal lifestyles. Many don’t know about the history side come with me on a journey to visit a few of these sites. Most of the destinations are reached by driving and a small amount of walking. &lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Common fish caught in the Estuary include herring, sand whiting, bream, cobbler, tailor and garfish. In season you can fish for salmon and tailor on the beach, and the Dawesville Cut is the best place to catch King George whiting.
Wherever you choose to cast your line, it is important to adhere to local fishing guidelines and legal size limits. 

In this location you will find an information ruler outlining the legal size limits for a variety of fish species. Examine this to answer the following question. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/03e30169-31d8-442d-bc07-e652a663c4cf" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mandurah’s Western Foreshore has recently undergone a transformation with the inclusion of a play space that is a hub for families and friends to meet, play and rest. 

Designed for people of all ages and abilities, the new play space will be full of fun and activity year-round. It is a place for people to gather, celebrate and explore in the beauty of Mandurah’s Western Foreshore.

The play space design is inspired by Mandurah’s heritage, character and world-renowned natural environment. It connects the land and water by featuring elements from Mandurah’s iconic waterways including boating and estuary themed sculptural play.

This recreation precinct also includes a skate and activity space, 
large picnic tables, drinking fountains, a seating deck and new toilet facilities. 

With so much on offer here, I invite you to spend a little while exploring the area. Enjoy!

It is a meeting place of the developed and natural.

The artwork entices viewers to explore and interact with it. Viewers experience unique angles from all perspectives as the artwork constantly changes and moves with the viewer. 

By day the artwork moves with the viewer, whereas at night the motion is driven by the animated lighting pulsing and dancing across the façade.

The nightly show further enhances the impact and iconic nature of the artwork. It appears as a floating illuminated helix responding to natural forces in real time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/03e30169-31d8-442d-bc07-e652a663c4cf" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mandurah’s Western Foreshore has recently undergone a transformation with the inclusion of a play space that is a hub for families and friends to meet, play and rest.

John Sutton came as indentured servant to James Tate and worked for him until 1843 farming the Peel region. 
John Sutton died in 1857 followed by his son Henry in 1861. This left his wife Eleanor Sutton the difficult job of managing the farm, inn and ferry service. She wrote home for help from relatives in Ireland and her nephew also called Henry Sutton was sent over in 1862. 
Eleanor died in 1868 leaving the Sutton estate to her nephew Henry who married Jane Mclarty in 1866. They went on to have 10 children and built a homestead and other buildings on the Sutton farm. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/94276232-3599-4262-a66f-87e112b844d9" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the Region of Peel.

Quite often with a specific pattern or design, lots of these were destroyed in the last bushfire, the design on this trail is the Xanthorrhoea australis or commonly known as a "black boy" or the more politically correct title of a grass tree.  However I am advised that many indigenous locals have always referred to them as black boys!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/c2f2c5b7-befb-464d-a211-5baf96d6e98f" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This 28 kilometre one way trail is based on the movement of Yellagonga and his people between Lake Joondalup and Yanchep.

Welcome to a small section of this trail.  This section runs approximately 1.5 Kilometres South from Yanchep Beach Road and follows about 8 of my Traditional caches towards the end of this section of the trail at Lacey Rd.  You can start anywhere along the trail but worth doing with the traditional's along that route, if you haven't already done it!

There is a "Bonus Cache" so you will need to take notes of the clues as you progress.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Out of several shafts sunk, no gold was discovered, but one appeared to show an abundant quantity of fire-clay. Ford and Murray formed the Clackline Firebrick Company in 1900 to test the deposit, and henceforth began operating an extensive quarry. The quarry had a practically limitless supply of clay. The quality of bricks produced by the refractory was at least comparable to those imported from England and Scotland, and at least one test showed that the imported bricks would fail before the local ones.

In 1901, the industry was important to Western Australia, with the brick products from Clackline used by multiple government departments, the Fremantle Gas Company, and many goldmines. Other users of the bricks included the Railway Department, the Perth Gas Company, the Fremantle smelter, and the Great Boulder Perseverance Company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/04c76173-e736-468d-8b52-0d7f1b9bd58c" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clackline was an important junction of three railway lines – remains of a turntable and platforms are reminders.

It is the only bridge in Western Australia to have spanned both a waterway and railway, the Clackline Brook and the former Eastern Railway alignment. 
The mainly timber bridge has a unique curved and sloped design, due to the difficult topography and the route of the former railway. 
The bridge was designed in 1934 to replace two dangerous rail crossings and a rudimentary water crossing. 
Construction began in January 1935, and was completed relatively quickly, with the opening ceremony held in August 1935.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/04c76173-e736-468d-8b52-0d7f1b9bd58c" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clackline was an important junction of three railway lines – remains of a turntable and platforms are reminders.

Fisherman's Hollow together with Yanchep Lagoon have been frequented by holiday makers and fishermen since the early 1900s. In 1926 Mary Lindsay purchased approximately 23,000 acres of land along the coast in the approximate location of Two Rocks. This became known as Yanchep Estate. A timber framed
homestead was constructed in the area north of Brazier Road and west of Two Rocks Road. This
has been totally renovated and is now an art studio/gallery and is your next visit on this adventure.

The hollow is still used as a popular picnic spot by locals and tourists and it has BBQ facilities and is an ideal spot to relax or kick a ball of walk your dog.  An ideal spot for Geocaching events and I have held 2 here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/8c216064-ccd7-4b93-bb4c-d9523e5b22a4" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A meander from the Wreck of the Alkimos to Leeman's Landing in Two Rocks, with some scenic outlooks and plenty of spots of historical significance on the way. 

This can easily be completed within a day or you could rush and do it in a few hours, however I recommend you take your time and explore the area and take in some of Western Australia's early history.  Some parts might have you thinking about the early European passengers who thought they were heading to Batavia (Jakarta) but ended up being shipwrecked on what is now the beautiful northern beaches of Perth.

It is best completed from south to north, however it can be completed in any order you like, parking is readily available at all points or for the fitter geocachers a bicycle ride is quite doable.

Keep a close eye on your answers at each stage, because there might be a "Bonus Box" (GC8ANQJ) published.

BUT before you do I suggest it is well worth a read of the history of this extraordinary woman and if you time you visit well, have a visit to the gallery and a chat with some of the volunteers who look after the place now it has been redeveloped.

FRIDAY is OPEN STUDIO 10am - 3pm Everyone is welcome to visit the studio, bring a project to work on or drop in for a coffee and a chat or look at the art work.
SUNDAY, the Gallery is OPEN to the public from 11am - 3pm. ALL WELCOME!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/8c216064-ccd7-4b93-bb4c-d9523e5b22a4" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A meander from the Wreck of the Alkimos to Leeman's Landing in Two Rocks, with some scenic outlooks and plenty of spots of historical significance on the way. 

This can easily be completed within a day or you could rush and do it in a few hours, however I recommend you take your time and explore the area and take in some of Western Australia's early history.  Some parts might have you thinking about the early European passengers who thought they were heading to Batavia (Jakarta) but ended up being shipwrecked on what is now the beautiful northern beaches of Perth.

It is best completed from south to north, however it can be completed in any order you like, parking is readily available at all points or for the fitter geocachers a bicycle ride is quite doable.

Keep a close eye on your answers at each stage, because there might be a "Bonus Box" (GC8ANQJ) published.

Running roughly from December to March the winds tend to be from the east with afternoon sea breezes giving some respite if you are close to the coast.

The cooler Birak season was a time of year for burning the land to help with fuel reduction, aid seed germination, clear grazing lands and ease travel across the land.

The hotter Bunuru and the respite of the cooler sea breeze had many people living nearer to coastal areas, rivers and estuaries and as such diets of seafoods became a staple for the people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/5831b488-1fdd-4ff3-8850-33840cedc500" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The South West of Western Australia is the land of the Noongar people.
Here the year is separated into six season, the signs of the land, animals and weather dictate the changing of the seasons.

It is the coldest and wettest part of the year, populations moves inland away from the coast and as such the diet changed from seafood to grazing animals such as the yongar (kangaroo).
These animals not only provided food, every part of the animal was used, the skins were made into coverings to protect through the cold and bones were fashioned into tools and weapons.

In nature you will see birds starting to pair up for breeding and the flowers changing from purples to whites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/5831b488-1fdd-4ff3-8850-33840cedc500" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The South West of Western Australia is the land of the Noongar people.

The weather starts to transition from the cold and wet of Makuru, there can be clear and cold nights and warmer rainy days.

The birds that were pairing up in the previous season now have chicks and parents will protect their nests, just like the koolbardi (magpie) and djidi djidi (willy wag tail).

Diet continued to be based around grazing animals such as the yongar (kangaroo), waitj (emu) and the koomal (possum).

Towards the end of the season the flower stalks of the balga (grass tree) start to grow in preparation for blooming in the new season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/5831b488-1fdd-4ff3-8850-33840cedc500" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The South West of Western Australia is the land of the Noongar people.

The winds change from the east to the south and decrease is intensity. Seeds, bullrushes and fresh water animals such as frogs and turtles come into the diet.
Red flowering plants dominate the flora providing nectar for insects and small mammals.
As the wet weather starts and the cooler nights become more common it signaled time to ensure the mia mia's (shelters) were repaired for the coming rains and winds of Makuru.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/5831b488-1fdd-4ff3-8850-33840cedc500" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The South West of Western Australia is the land of the Noongar people.

Smaller and more delicate flowers dominate the season, Kangaroo Paws and orchids are in high abundance.

The days are getting longer and the warm weather is returning. It is this time of year that you are most likely to encounter snakes. They are breaking their hibernation and will be seeking any warmth they can find to assist them in searching for food.

This tree is 400+ years old with a 1m diameter and height of 19m.
Significance: this tree has horticultural value due to its great age, the seeds are also important as a gene pool resource, it’s outstanding height, circumference and canopy spread. It’s colourful bark, highlighted by the rays of sunshine makes a significant aesthetic contribution to the immediate landscape of the street. 
History: it’s age at 420+ years means that it would have been 25 years old at the time the Dutch explorer Willem Janos discovered Australia in 1606. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/c378ab2c-ff17-4c4b-b2ae-c27b615e8f45" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The National Trusts of Australia are community based, non government organisations, committed to promoting and conserving Australia’s indigenous, natural and historic heritage places and objects. The National Trusts of Australia are collaborating to create a national register of significant trees, which is consistent with their mission to protect and celebrate Australia’s heritage. There are over 2,500 significant tree records compiled over thirty years across Australia. 
This adventure lab focuses on five trees 100+ years of age. 
Jarrah Tree - Armadale: Historic value; at 1500+ years, this tree reflects the great age of the species and is a significant remnant of the period prior to European colonisation.
Scientific value; the girth and age of this Eucalyptus margin at a makes it valuable as a benchmark site with potential to contribute to future research. Unfortunately it has been significantly impacted by development and vandalism.

It is still there but starting to corrode rather badly. 

The cover photo for this was taken last year after the winds and storms had uncovered the wreck and this shows the old plaque in the distance.  Do not go down to the wreck site, as there is now a Permanent Conservation Order on the wreck now, however you can get great views form the hill not too far of a walk from GZ, or from the old plaque.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/8c216064-ccd7-4b93-bb4c-d9523e5b22a4" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A meander from the Wreck of the Alkimos to Leeman's Landing in Two Rocks, with some scenic outlooks and plenty of spots of historical significance on the way. 

This can easily be completed within a day or you could rush and do it in a few hours, however I recommend you take your time and explore the area and take in some of Western Australia's early history.  Some parts might have you thinking about the early European passengers who thought they were heading to Batavia (Jakarta) but ended up being shipwrecked on what is now the beautiful northern beaches of Perth.

It is best completed from south to north, however it can be completed in any order you like, parking is readily available at all points or for the fitter geocachers a bicycle ride is quite doable.

Keep a close eye on your answers at each stage, because there might be a "Bonus Box" (GC8ANQJ) published.

I think this raises some interesting questions or thoughts as to what happened to the survivors or the original wreck!

Some great rock formations here, and if you wonder down to the beach you can see where the name Two Rocks comes from.

Worth a visit up to the shopping centre at Two Rock and the old car park for Atlantis the old water theme park and the statue of King Neptune.  Also full of interesting history, and could be another Adventure Lab Cache, if more get given out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/8c216064-ccd7-4b93-bb4c-d9523e5b22a4" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A meander from the Wreck of the Alkimos to Leeman's Landing in Two Rocks, with some scenic outlooks and plenty of spots of historical significance on the way.

It was approximately  1 hectare in size and some of the building foundations can still be seen today.

The  Camp  took its first  prisoners  in August 1943 and released its last in April,1946. It was built to accommodate 1,200 men, including Army  personnel,  and thousands of prisoners passed through its gates. Most were Italian and German, who were put into separate compounds in accordance with the Geneva Convention.  &lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Despite the passage of time, two major wildfires and reclamation of this site by the forest, the stonework remains distinct. Renowned for excellence in stone masonry and carpentry Italian prisoners worked with dedication on these projects such as a goldfish pond and shaped flower beds.
Evidence of these skills extends far beyond the perimeters of this POW camp.

Political extremists were considered unsuitable for Marrinup and serious offences were dealt with by Court Martial. Camp life was however not free from tension and discontent.
German and Italian prisoners were confined in separate barracks. Each cell had a door and a window.

They threw themselves into activities that nourished the sense of their homelands. Italian prisoners made their own vermiclli and macaroni and supplemented their diet with vegetables grown in the camp's vegetable garden. German prisoners made their own sauerkraut and borscht and spent time mending and remaking their uniforms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/7b9f0635-d917-440a-a204-9f359d8efaf6" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One POW camp and 30 control centres were located in WA.  The POW Camp, Number 16 Prisoner of War Compound and Garrison, was built at Marrinup, near Dwellingup, to provide farm labour and cut firewood for the State capital, Perth.  It was approximately  1 hectare in size and some of the building foundations can still be seen today.

The  Camp  took its first  prisoners  in August 1943 and released its last in April,1946. It was built to accommodate 1,200 men, including Army  personnel,  and thousands of prisoners passed through its gates. Most were Italian and German, who were put into separate compounds in accordance with the Geneva Convention.  &lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Their local staff have many combined years of experience and are always passionate about passing on their knowledge. The centre is famous for providing local products as well as maps, souvenirs, information on local flora and fauna, picture books, history books, guides and information brochures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/21959691-17ba-4c36-b7c3-8273019465a6" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We all like exploring new areas and geocaching does this by taking us to spots where we would not have known about or ever thought to go.  Another way would be to visit the Visitor Centre's at those locations which will have some great advice and can showcase local attractions.

This Lab takes you on a tour of the Visitor Centre's around the Perth Hills area and nearby satellite towns.

You will need to allow an afternoon to take a leisurely drive throughout the district to complete this adventure lab and claim the bonus at the end.  It is recommended that you start at Mundaring and follow through to Toodyay, Northam, York and finally Beverley - however you can do them in any order you choose.

Good Luck and enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Many items have a story - like the Coca- Cola sign that once advertised a Louis Armstrong Concert or the red plastic chairs for the café’s al fresco diners, snapped up from the Sydney 2000 Olympics.

The townsite of Toodyay is located on the Avon River in the central agricultural region. It is one of the earliest inland towns in the state, and was surveyed in 1833 following the settlement of the Avon region. However, the townsite's location on the Avon was subject to flooding, and in 1860 an alternative site about 5 km higher up the Avon was gazetted as a townsite and named Newcastle (probably named after the Duke of Newcastle, Secretary of State 1853). 

In 1909 the Prime Minister wrote to the state government requesting consideration be given to changing the name of Newcastle because of duplication with Newcastle in New South Wales. The Prime Minister suggested the name Toodyay be considered. The Newcastle Municipality at first opposed the change, but following a referendum of residents the name change to Toodyay was supported. The change was gazetted in May 1910, and at the same time the Toodyay townsite was renamed West Toodyay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/02bfc544-156d-4cad-a499-2bcc61ab7736" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the West Oz Geocaching Road Trip adventure taking you to some interesting locations in Western Australia.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

The bricks were made at the riverside and the lime was carried from Clackline. Woods ran a store on the site and obtained a storekeeper's gallon licence. In 1875 Woods added eight rooms to the store and from 1880 provided a venue for dances in the "long room". In 1882 Woods applied for a Billiard and Bagatelle License.

Different tribes used to travel through the Dwellingup forest area to access watering holes and use caves as stop over for shelter, before moving down onto the open coastal plain. The Darling Scarp and forest environment was therefore an important area for hunting, gathering, tool making and movement of Aboriginal tribes before the colonisation.

Primarily a timber mill town when gazetted in 1910, Dwellingup became the administrative centre for a number of neighbouring mill towns which popped up after the opening of the railway from Pinjarra to Dwellingup.

This marks the spot where the first peg was driven into the ground by Surveyor William F Rudell on 19 October 1909.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/b61a24aa-07de-4f97-90fa-3a81d9a0e69e" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This Adventure will take you on a small tour of the town of Dwellingup.  

At the end of the Adventure, you will receive the coordinates for a Bonus Cache located a short drive away: Dwellingup Trails AL Bonus Box (GC940X8).

Seeing as you have driven all the way here, I recommend you park at the visitor centre and take the opportunity to stretch the legs and walk to the various locations. It won't take longer than half an hour.

It is worth taking the time to check out the visitor centre either before or after your walk.  And if you have even more time to spend in the area, there is a lot to explore.  Take a ride on the Hotham Valley Railway, go camping or adventuring at Lane Pool Reserve, there are heaps of trails to explore by foot, bike, horse or 4WD - and this is is one of the few places the Bibbulmun and the Munda Biddi tracks intersect.

Or if too much adventure is not your thing, just spend time in town checking out some of the unique attractions.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Surrounded by forest and with the Murray River close by, the town offers a number of attractions including delightful orchards, an old fashioned pub (with an interesting history), an award winning cidery, adventure activities, equipment hire and a recently completed skate park and pump track. It's also home to the Hotham Valley Railway, a steam train which provides a novel way to be dropped off for an 8km walk back to town on the Bibbulmun Track.

Dwellingup is situated in a timber and fruit-growing district east of Pinjarra. It has a population of around 400, and the name is derived from the Nyoongar word for "place of nearby water" relating to the proximity of the Murray River. In the early twentieth century the major industries of this district were farming, timber milling and railway sleeper cutting. The Track is aligned in many places along the old railway formations.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/a4bbaae6-16b8-4dd7-a15a-aff6097da10b" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bibbulmun Track is one of the world’s great long distance walk trails, stretching 1000km from Kalamunda in the Perth Hills, to Albany on the south coast, winding through the heart of the scenic South West of Western Australia.

The Track is for walkers only and is signposted with yellow triangular markers symbolising the Waugal, the rainbow serpent of the Aboriginal Dreaming. Trail markers are spaced up to 500m apart.

Nyoongar people are known and acknowledged as the traditional owners and custodians of the land and waters over which the Bibbulmun Track passes. Nyoongar people have a deep spiritual, emotional, social and physical connection to “country” (Boodja). Nyoongar people ask you to please respect the Boodja when you walk the Bibbulmun Track to ensure its natural and cultural values are preserved for all future generations.

This Lab will take you on five towns that it runs by and is used as a break/restock of supplies by those walking the track.

Here you will find an actual log and whim.  If you are interested in finding out more about the forrest, the Forest Heritage Centre is a 5-10 minute walk north (follow the emu footprints!).  There is an interpretive centre, a treetop walk, and a range of nature, forestry and indigenous based tours.

Just across the road from where you are standing is the Dwellingup Hotel.  It was built by Mr Hugh McNeil in 1911 and is the oldest building remaining in the town, having survived the 1961 fire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/b61a24aa-07de-4f97-90fa-3a81d9a0e69e" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This Adventure will take you on a small tour of the town of Dwellingup.

Mick French lived in Dwellingup for 80 years, and loved spending time in his garden.  

There is now a Mick French Award at the annual Dwellingup Rose Show each autumn.

If roses aren't your thing, how about pumpkins?  Dwellingup hosts an annual Pumpkin Festival each autumn which includes a giant pumpkin weigh-off.

Or check out the Dwellingup Country Markets hosted by the Dwellingup Country Womens Association volunteers every third Sunday of the month from March to December in the garden at the CWA Hall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/b61a24aa-07de-4f97-90fa-3a81d9a0e69e" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This Adventure will take you on a small tour of the town of Dwellingup.

A major bushfire devastated Dwellingup and surrounding towns in January 1961.  People gathered at the school, football oval and the hotel to escape the fire. 

The RSL Hall managed to survive, and was used to house people who lost their homes.

WA's first recorded export of Jarrah, known as Swan River Mahogany by the first settlers, was in February 1831.  The industry grew, with increasing demand for Jarrah in the form of sleepers, paving, piles and pales.

Before steam locomotives took over their role, Clydesdale horses were used for transporting logs from the bush to the mill and were used extensively in the timber industry during the late 1800’s to early 1900’s.

A whim was used to allow a team of horses to pull logs from the bush to the mill’s bush landing, where the logs were loaded onto rail trolleys and hauled by another team of horses to the mill. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/b61a24aa-07de-4f97-90fa-3a81d9a0e69e" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This Adventure will take you on a small tour of the town of Dwellingup.

York was the first inland settlement in Western Australia and the town has many historic, heritage-listed Victorian and Federation buildings.  An abundance of local activities and facilities make it an attractive destination and a fantastic place to live.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/21959691-17ba-4c36-b7c3-8273019465a6" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We all like exploring new areas and geocaching does this by taking us to spots where we would not have known about or ever thought to go.  Another way would be to visit the Visitor Centre's at those locations which will have some great advice and can showcase local attractions.

This Lab takes you on a tour of the Visitor Centre's around the Perth Hills area and nearby satellite towns.

You will need to allow an afternoon to take a leisurely drive throughout the district to complete this adventure lab and claim the bonus at the end.  It is recommended that you start at Mundaring and follow through to Toodyay, Northam, York and finally Beverley - however you can do them in any order you choose.

Good Luck and enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

It was constructed by prominent builder, innovative farmer and developer Friedrich Wilhelm Gustav Liebe, and is also associated with Edward Keane, a leading railway builder. It was part of the development of the Midland-Walkaway Railway that provided the essential transport for pastoral and agricultural development in the region.

It is a fine representative example of the Federation period of architecture and of development in Gingin at that time, making a significant contribution to the townscape heritage. It is also significant for associations with various owners and managers including John Musk, wife Catherine, Tom Jones and others, and demonstrates a sense of place for the social and hospitality functions of the place.

The building is said to be haunted complete with terrifying stories of paranormal encounters from very 'credible witnesses'.  Fortunately, you can get all the information you need from the York Heritage Trail plaque in front of the building.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/c452bfad-b838-47c2-add9-bdb16cad50e0" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Welcome to York, the first and therefore the oldest inland town in Western Australia.  This delightful country town is situated on the Avon River on Ballardong Nyoongar land.  Within an hour's drive from Perth, York provides an escape to a place bursting with natural, cultural and historical hidden gems.
The Adventure Lab will take you for a casual stroll on an easy circuit to places of significant historical interest including locations with links to the town's convict past.
Although the locations can be visited in any order, a good place to start would be the Swing Bridge where there is ample parking and conveniences,
Please note that several of the places of interest are privately owned and the required information can be found on plaques adjacent to the footpaths.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

It was built as the Depot Superintendent's Quarters and is the last remaining part of the York Convict Depot.  As a museum, it now provides a fascinating insight into the history of the region. Even if it is closed, there are information panels and old relics of bygone eras on display outside. On the front wall, there is also a brass plaque sponsored by Nicholas Hasluck, a retired judge and poet who has a home in York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/c452bfad-b838-47c2-add9-bdb16cad50e0" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Welcome to York, the first and therefore the oldest inland town in Western Australia.

It represents the vigorous lobbying by the Gingin community for its construction and the associated connection to the telegraph line from Perth to Geraldton. It represents the complementary association between police and postal service in the early development of public facilities. The residence demonstrates the role and lifestyle of the postmaster at the time.

You will find information to answer the question on the brown information sign to the south east of the post office building.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/3a69ce78-35ff-45b8-b9af-e3631375a519" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gingin is one of the oldest towns in the State, with explorers and pioneers arriving in 1831, just two years after the Swan River Colony was proclaimed. To this day Gingin retains some important remnants of its pioneering days dating back to the 1850s. Join us on a short tour of Gingin and some of its sites near Granville Park.

Northam townsite was set aside in November 1830. Northam achieved prominence with the extension of railway to the Goldfields in 1894. It became an important centre for the provision of public services such as railways, roads, and water supplies.
In 1949 after the 2nd World War - Northams Millitary Hospital and Army Camp became the  Commonwealth  Immigration Accommodation Centre accommodating
 thousands of refugees.  With the refugees later settling in Northam it gave the town a population mix quite different to most other rural towns. A number of them worked on the water supply scheme.

The friendly staff at the Visitor Centre will be able to offer advice on places to see, stay and eat while you are in the area, information on heritage sites and the places of interest that you may enjoy during your stay. 

The Centre includes an interpretive space featuring the “Sense of Place” Migrant Exhibition, Northam’s First People Exhibition, and environmental displays. While you are at the Centre you will also have the opportunity to browse through a wide range of local produce and artwork, and a great selection of souvenirs and gifts to remember your time in Northam. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/21959691-17ba-4c36-b7c3-8273019465a6" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We all like exploring new areas and geocaching does this by taking us to spots where we would not have known about or ever thought to go.  Another way would be to visit the Visitor Centre's at those locations which will have some great advice and can showcase local attractions.

This Lab takes you on a tour of the Visitor Centre's around the Perth Hills area and nearby satellite towns.

You will need to allow an afternoon to take a leisurely drive throughout the district to complete this adventure lab and claim the bonus at the end.  It is recommended that you start at Mundaring and follow through to Toodyay, Northam, York and finally Beverley - however you can do them in any order you choose.

Good Luck and enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Northam townsite was set aside in November 1830. Northam achieved prominence with the extension of railway to the Goldfields in 1894. It became an important centre for the provision of public services such as railways, roads, and water supplies.
In 1949 after the 2nd World War - Northams Millitary Hospital and Army Camp became the  Commonwealth  Immigration Accommodation Centre accommodating
 thousands of refugees.  With the refugees later settling in Northam it gave the town a population mix quite different to most other rural towns. A number of them worked on the water supply scheme.

Located at Yalgorup National Park, south of Mandurah, the thrombolite reef at Lake Clifton offers you a glimpse of what life was like when the earth began.

These rock-like formations are found in only a few places in the world and scientists believe that thrombolites are one of the first life forms on earth, dating back approximately 570 million years, producing oxygen that made all subsequent life possible.

The Lake Clifton thrombolites are approximately 2,000 years old and the largest in the southern hemisphere. You can view them from above on a boardwalk over the lake with January to May being the best time to see them when the water levels are low.

Waroona, a word of unknown origin, was used as the term for the settlement which grew up around the local timber mill.

At the northern entrance to the town, and located in the park next to the Visitor Information Centre, are a series of Heritage Bush Poles. They are carved and painted jarrah poles which form a striking and impressive entrance to the town.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/3de6cb8d-13fc-4aec-90e3-a2dd257ecc2d" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before the Forrest Hwy was opened in 2009 one of the main routes to Bunbury was along the South Western Hwy. The old road to Bunbury passes through several towns which this Adventure Lab will cause you to visit. &lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

The Visitor Centre stocks an array of Beverley souvenirs, gifts, fresh coffee beans and many locally-made products.

The friendly Beverley Visitor Centre staff will help you discover all the wonderful things Beverley and it’s surrounds has to offer. Whether you enjoy life at a slower pace or you like to live on the edge, Beverley will have something for you to enjoy. If you are a nature lover, grab your camera and head out to Yenyening Lakes or take a hike up County Peak for panoramic views of the great region. Or if you want take a step back in time, visit the Dead Finish Museum, Avondale Agricultural Museum and Fergusons Vintage Collection to see what life was like for Beverley pioneers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/21959691-17ba-4c36-b7c3-8273019465a6" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We all like exploring new areas and geocaching does this by taking us to spots where we would not have known about or ever thought to go.  Another way would be to visit the Visitor Centre's at those locations which will have some great advice and can showcase local attractions.

This Lab takes you on a tour of the Visitor Centre's around the Perth Hills area and nearby satellite towns.

You will need to allow an afternoon to take a leisurely drive throughout the district to complete this adventure lab and claim the bonus at the end.  It is recommended that you start at Mundaring and follow through to Toodyay, Northam, York and finally Beverley - however you can do them in any order you choose.

Good Luck and enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

The fountain commemorates the centenary of the local government in the Beverley District.

The official survey of the Beverley district occurred in 1843.

Carefully read the plaque on the fountain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/0e20e958-6f1b-41ca-83c5-9c9952122eb5" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beverley is a wheatbelt town 130km east of Perth on the Avon River. Founded in 1838, Beverley is one of Western Australia’s oldest settlements.

The town is lucky to play host to well known artist James Giddy who visited in June 2017. He painted animals throughout the town centre, in a medium known as ‘en plain air’, simply translated to painting ‘in open air’.

This adventure lab takes you on a journey of his brilliant murals leaving a lasting mark on Vincent Street.

Stop and have a coffee at one of the cafes and explore the railway station art gallery. The skate park and playground should be a hit for the kids.

You will collect a letter from four of the locations and a suffix containing 5 characters at another. This clue will be the code required for the bonus box.  The BB is a short walk to the east of the murals. I would start the adventure at the fountain.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Tullis Bridge now remains as two separate structures at either side of the riverbank as it was set alight in the early 1990’s by some campers in the area. 

At Tullis Bridge there are picnic tables and a public toilet. 
A 3km walk trail has been created out at Tullis Bridge that takes you around the bridge and surrounding river.  

There is limited signal at Tullis bridge, it is recommened that you keep the app open during the drive to this location.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/71563ee4-6257-4c3c-a3cf-253849e6da04" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;History
The town owes its name to an early settler, Henry Boddington, who was a farmer and shepherd in the 1860s and 1870s and leased land in the area in 1875.

The area declined slowly over time, and the 1961 Western Australian bushfires devastated the local timber industry. Boddington became a typical small service area for the surrounding district. However, the establishment of bauxite mining in 1979 to service Western Australia's alumina production at Worsley, Kwinana and Wagerup, and the opening of the Boddington Gold Mine in 1987 created a thriving mining town.

Present day
Boddington is located 11 kilometres (7 mi) off Albany Highway and 123 kilometres (76 mi) southeast of Perth in the Darling Scarp. Boddington each year on the first weekend of November hosts a 3-day rodeo.

A Royal Historical Society plaque near the town marks the grave of a local Aboriginal named Quency Dilyan who helped explorers Alexander Forrest and H. S. Ranford during their expeditions in the area. &lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

The earliest meeting was held in the year of 1976. Together they successfully organised and constructed some important infrastructure in the Shire of Boddington. One of the biggest projects was undertaken on the edge of Hotham River. Damming, enhancing, and clearing, was assisted by Bunnings workers, Waroona contracting services, and the Shire of Boddington. 

The place was intended as a scenic attraction and became a much harder job than initially thought. Alfred Gillespie and Marlon Reid obtained a cable digger from the Bauxite Mine which was considered a major asset for the completion of the task. Stabilizing the wall was the most difficult, taking10 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/71563ee4-6257-4c3c-a3cf-253849e6da04" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;History
The town owes its name to an early settler, Henry Boddington, who was a farmer and shepherd in the 1860s and 1870s and leased land in the area in 1875.

The area declined slowly over time, and the 1961 Western Australian bushfires devastated the local timber industry. Boddington became a typical small service area for the surrounding district. However, the establishment of bauxite mining in 1979 to service Western Australia's alumina production at Worsley, Kwinana and Wagerup, and the opening of the Boddington Gold Mine in 1987 created a thriving mining town.

Present day
Boddington is located 11 kilometres (7 mi) off Albany Highway and 123 kilometres (76 mi) southeast of Perth in the Darling Scarp. Boddington each year on the first weekend of November hosts a 3-day rodeo.

A Royal Historical Society plaque near the town marks the grave of a local Aboriginal named Quency Dilyan who helped explorers Alexander Forrest and H. S. Ranford during their expeditions in the area. &lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

The Settlers' Association were responsible for building and managing the Hall. It was made of timber weatherboard and corrugated iron. 
In 1957, the new Hall was built despite community opposition. 
Internal features within the Hall were considered significantly progressive for the 1950's. These features included a projector room, a cloak room, a proscenium arch stage with rear access, adjacent dressing rooms, internal toilets, and an established kitchen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/71563ee4-6257-4c3c-a3cf-253849e6da04" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;History

Wandering is primarily an agricultural region, which produces hay, cereal crops, pulse crops (such as lupins), oil seed (canola), wool, lamb and beef. Timber milling and viticulture are also practised. The town's school still operates with mixed-grade classes, and accommodation is offered at a caravan park with powered sites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/6dc6050d-a8df-49ba-8a19-a2540647fc01" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The area's name appears to come from a local Aboriginal word, "wandooin", after the wandoo or white gum tree that is prevalent in the area, although some sources suggest it was named to recall the first sighting of wandering stock, and was originally applied to Wandering Brook, first recorded in 1866.

Wandering was first settled in 1859 by members of the George Stedman Watts family when their straying wagon team horses were found grazing in lush grass around a fresh water spring known to this day as Horse Well. In 1861, they selected an area on what is now the south-eastern approach to the town, and named it "Grassdale".&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Wandering was first settled in 1859 by members of the George Stedman Watts family when their straying wagon team horses were found grazing in lush grass around a fresh water spring known to this day as Horse Well. In 1861, they selected an area on what is now the south-eastern approach to the town, and named it "Grassdale".&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Over a seven-minute period, the fire also burned the historic timber workshops, factories, an old church, the old hospital, shops, the hotel, fire station and a part of the school.

Public access to Yarloop was restored on 11 August 2016, seven months after the fire, when roadblocks were removed. A new community centre was built, incorporating the facade of the original town hall, and opened in November 2019.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/3de6cb8d-13fc-4aec-90e3-a2dd257ecc2d" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before the Forrest Hwy was opened in 2009 one of the main routes to Bunbury was along the South Western Hwy. The old road to Bunbury passes through several towns which this Adventure Lab will cause you to visit. &lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

All burial records were destroyed by fire in 1927.  In 1966 its11 acres were cleared to allow for an expansion of the Meckering golf links.Sadly this one grave and the headstones are all that remains. You are looking for the one grave.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/2607e740-9581-4825-8507-65fe73ace4d1" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Golden Pipeline Heritage Trail follows the water pipeline conceived by C.Y.O'Connor to supply the Goldfields of Western Australia with much needed fresh water.
Meckering - a town along the way, benefited from the pipeline and still does today. Once a thriving country town, the devastation of an earthquake in 1968 flattened the town and it has never fully recovered.
This Adventure Lab will take you on a trip into the history of this little town.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

The design was a mixture of ideas put forward by the art departments of Harvey and Australind Senior High Schools. A design competition, which was won by a group of Harvey students.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/3de6cb8d-13fc-4aec-90e3-a2dd257ecc2d" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before the Forrest Hwy was opened in 2009 one of the main routes to Bunbury was along the South Western Hwy.

M. Sewell in 1889.In about 1902 added a top storey. Early license holders were Ernie Monger, George Murdock, Harold Sewell, John Elsegood, Frank Markwell Snr, John Moss, Douglas Marwell.

While the town is pleasant and unassuming the surrounding area is known for its remarkable remnants of the flora and fauna which existed before the district was farmed.

Location
Pingelly is located 154 km south-east of Perth and 297 m above sea level.

Origin of Name
By 1873 maps of the area were referring to Pingeculling Rocks. It is believed that "pinge" was a local Aboriginal word meaning "small gully" and "culling" was water. The small settlement became known as "Pinge Gully" or "Pinge Culling" but when the railway reached the town in the late 1880s the spelling became "Pingelly".

Construction would have been circa 1900. The building has hosted Pingelly Hardware &amp; Rural Supplies and the Pingelly Lunch Bar over the years. It was also once a boarding house.

Another classic building in Pingelly. Some lovely decorations along the front of the roof.

Can you imagine when you born in 1800's what clothes you would have worn from this shop?

A rather grand building at 7 Parade Street that was built in 1912 for the Union Bank. The manager lived on the first floor. When this photo was taken the building was up for sale. Signage indicates this was also once a newsagency, bookstore, stationer and jeweller (all at the same time). Another time it was tea rooms and a bed and breakfast. What a history. This is currently a private residence. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/6e99795e-4d4d-42d7-886e-fe143aed6193" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pingelly is a quiet, rural service centre surrounded by a rural area which produces wheat, barley, sheep and cattle.

In September 1906, telephone communications were established between Pingelly and Popanyinning. By 1907, a telegram lodged at Wagin took five hours to reach Pingelly. During 1908, a telephone exchange was established and the connections extended to Narrogin and Beverley. Eight gas street lights were installed in 1906, and in 1912 the service was electrified

While the town is pleasant and unassuming the surrounding area is known for its remarkable remnants of the flora and fauna which existed before the district was farmed.

Location
Pingelly is located 154 km south-east of Perth and 297 m above sea level.

Origin of Name
By 1873 maps of the area were referring to Pingeculling Rocks. It is believed that "pinge" was a local Aboriginal word meaning "small gully" and "culling" was water. The small settlement became known as "Pinge Gully" or "Pinge Culling" but when the railway reached the town in the late 1880s the spelling became "Pingelly".

In 1955 the building was renovated and reopened as a hotel. It operated until January 2020, when the Board of the Benedictine Community decided, with regret, to permanently close the hotel. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/2fa8714d-7bbf-457d-a958-153ce7f66b93" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New Norcia is Australia's only monastic town. Founded in 1847 by Spanish Benedictine Monks, the catholic mission quickly grew into a small self-sufficient town. The town’s focus has changed over the years. From missionary work, to monastic and pastoral duties, to education, and now tourism.

A gem in the bush and a place of deep serenity, New Norcia is a place of beautiful historic buildings and spectacular landscapes. 

We would like to take you on a quick tour of the township. There’s much more to see than the five locations we have chosen. The route will take you past some other places where you might like to stop and explore. 

The waypoints will need to be collected in sequential order. This is so that we can deliver coordinates for our “Bonus Box” (GC91G24) when you have visited the final waypoint.

So, take your time and enjoy the peace and beauty of this truly unique place.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

The old convent included a chapel, an infirmary, workrooms, and quarters for the sisters. 

This building now serves as the tourism hub for New Norcia. Inside is the visitors centre and gift shop as well as an art gallery/museum.

Founded in 1847 by Spanish Benedictine Monks, the catholic mission quickly grew into a small self-sufficient town. The town’s focus has changed over the years. From missionary work, to monastic and pastoral duties, to education, and now tourism.

A gem in the bush and a place of deep serenity, New Norcia is a place of beautiful historic buildings and spectacular landscapes. 

We would like to take you on a quick tour of the township. There’s much more to see than the five locations we have chosen. The route will take you past some other places where you might like to stop and explore. 

The waypoints will need to be collected in sequential order. This is so that we can deliver coordinates for our “Bonus Box” (GC91G24) when you have visited the final waypoint.

So, take your time and enjoy the peace and beauty of this truly unique place.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

These houses were home to aboriginal families. New Norcia's original purpose was as a mission. The idea being to convert the Yued people - the traditional owners of this area - to Catholicism.

By the early 1900's, some of the indigenous people had left New Norcia and a few of the cottages were occupied by european families. The last of the cottages were demolished in 1950 and now only a few foundations remain.

The nearby heptagonal building was built around 1983 to commemorate a fire which threatened to burn down the newly founded mission in 1847. The brothers believed that they were saved by a painting of the Virgin Mary. More detail about this story can be found on the eastern side of the building. 

Today the Marian shrine is used as an interpretation centre for the mission cottages. There is information inside about the lives of aboriginal people on the mission. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/2fa8714d-7bbf-457d-a958-153ce7f66b93" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New Norcia is Australia's only monastic town.

The current building was completed in 1863, with the belfry added in 1908. Bishop Salvado (the founding bishop of New Norcia) is entombed inside. 

The church is still in use today. If the door is open, feel free to have a look inside. There is some impressive artwork and a large organ. 

Directly opposite the church are the gates to the monastery cloister. The monastery building as we see it today was built around the original mission house, with sections and wings being added over several decades. The Benedictines have lived and worked on this site for more than 170 years. 

The street between these two buildings was the original main road of New Norcia. The current main road was constructed in the 1920's, moving traffic away from the monastery. In 2017, Main Roads completed the Great Northern Highway bypass of New Norcia, which has surely made meditation even easier. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/2fa8714d-7bbf-457d-a958-153ce7f66b93" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New Norcia is Australia's only monastic town.

As a youth in Ireland, he was a member of the Irish Republican Brotherhood, or Fenians, for which he was transported to Western Australia. After escaping to the United States, he became a prominent spokesperson for the Irish community and culture through his editorship of the Boston newspaper The Pilot, his prolific writing and his lecture tours.

In 1864 he joined the Irish Republican Brotherhood under an assumed name and was part of the group for two years until he and many others were arrested by authorities in early 1866. After a trial the same year he was sentenced to death which was  later commuted to 20 years' penal servitude. In 1867 O'Reilly was transported to Western Australia and moved to the town of Bunbury where he escaped two years later.

Many people have sought food and shelter here including Nyoongars, early settlers, Indian labourers and alternative lifestylers. All these people have shared the ability to be resourceful and inventive to enable them to live in this challenging environment.
Belvidere was one of the first farms established in the South-West. Thomas Little and his labourers began establishing the horse and cattle farm here in 1840 on behalf of their employer, Charles Robert Prinsep of Calcutta.  Little name the homestead and property Belvidere after Charles Prinsep's house in Calcutta.

The town also hosts several historic buildings, including the shire hall, Catholic and Anglican churches and railway cottages, and the nearby Beela Valley has a scenic drive which takes in farming country east of the town as well as the Mornington forests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/3de6cb8d-13fc-4aec-90e3-a2dd257ecc2d" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before the Forrest Hwy was opened in 2009 one of the main routes to Bunbury was along the South Western Hwy.

A town site of 1000 acres was surveyed and the division of 100,000 acres into small farms was planned through causes beyond the control of settlers and despite the labours of the Chief Commissioner Marshall Waller Clifton, F.R.S the achievement fell short of the vision.

This memorial recalls the vision, commemorated those hardy pioneers who continued to labour here in face of great difficulty and records the benefit Western Australia received from the coming of settlers and official in the ships

The circular patterning and waterways depicted in the artwork celebrate the link between people and nature; and how we are all connected through history.

The half arcs represent seated people in Noongar symbolism. They are a reminder of all who came before us and all who call this home today.

We see the echoes of federation design, in the style of circular ceiling roses and lace handcrafts, brought to our shores by convicts and settlers.....

Over the years of attending the club my fondest memories are of sitting around the fire on winter nights, driving cars back to the clubhouse after long days at the far ends of the airfield (at age 8) and setting up cubby houses. Washing down the gliders at the start of each day and the long lines of aircraft waiting on the edge of the runway during the state championships.

It was here that I learned to ride a bike and fly planes; although lots has changed over the years, everything is still familiar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/bf292e1c-19f3-4fc5-9d54-d65eeedbb258" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BE AWARE: The airfield can be busy, especially on weekends, make sure you drive slowly and are aware of aircraft when walking around.

My childhood and youth are filled with memories of Friday afternoons piling into the car and heading down to Narrogin to spend the weekend at the gliding club. On occasions, summer holidays were spent in the town and its surrounds.

So many great stories were had here and in the town and this lab aims to share those memories with you.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Flight operations for the afternoon were suspended when a call came over the radio that an Army plan was approaching the area on a training exercise.
15 minutes later the roar of 2 C-130 aircraft came along runway 36 depositing a number of jeeps along behind them on their passes.
Once the exercise was over the planes lined up with the jeeps and while we were given permission to explore the equipment the army cooked up a big feed for everyone on the bbq.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/bf292e1c-19f3-4fc5-9d54-d65eeedbb258" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BE AWARE: The airfield can be busy, especially on weekends, make sure you drive slowly and are aware of aircraft when walking around.

To overcome this, as well as provide protection for ships in the bay and those moored alongside the Bunbury Timber Jetty, a breakwater was built at Casuarina Point in 1897-1900. 
Bunbury Timber Jetty was originally constructed in 1864 by convicts and was the first harbour loading facility in Bunbury. William Forrest, the father of Sir John and Alexander, was contracted to build the jetty at a cost of £200. 
In response to the ongoing problem of damaged and wrecked boats in Koombana Bay, C. Y. O’Connor, the Engineer-in-Chief at the Public Works Department, p roposed and designed a “Pierres Perdues” type breakwater, following a curve in a north-east direction with approximately a half mile radius. When completed, the breakwater was (3,215 feet) 980metres in length.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/65f6c6fa-9222-4141-8dde-2ac794576de2" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;O’Connor, the first Engineer in Chief, was born on 11 January 1843 at ‘Gravelmount’, Castletown, near Navan, County Meath, Ireland.
At 17 he began training to become a civil engineer, and he quickly gained experience working on railway construction and water-control projects. In 1865 O'Connor migrated to New Zealand to begin his career in this field.
During his time in New Zealand he worked on projects that involved supplying water to goldmines, improving harbour facilities, and constructing railway tracks, roads, and bridges. This work gained him an international reputation, and led to his election to the Institution of Civil Engineers, London in 1880.
In April 1891, Sir John Forrest, premier of Western Australia, offered O'Connor the position of Engineer-in-Chief working for the Public Works Department. When O'Connor asked whether his responsibilities would cover railways, harbours or roads, Forrest replied with "Everything".

Marsh collected stones to surround his fire and the stones caught alight. Marsh, unaware of the significance of his find, reported it to Perren, who later claimed that the ‘stones’ Marsh had found were pieces he (Perren) had found previously. Perren kept the discovery a secret and searched for the deposit with no success. He later confided in his brother who exposed the discovery. Bunbury merchant David Hay heard the story and convinced Perren to enter into an agreement with Perren where Hay would take up a 300-acre lease in joint names with Perren if he showed him the location. Perren and Hay found some coal, but failed to find the source.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/7d7caf73-45ae-4d05-a666-7b934f22c356" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the Collie coalfields explore through some of the history of the Collie Coalfields.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

The Bay is home to over 100 wild bottlenose dolphins who often visit the Dolphin Discovery Centre's beach in knee-high water. The centre runs year-round eco cruises out into the bay where you will see the dolphins in their natural habitat. In summer their "Swim with Dolphin" tour operates where you can swim with wild dolphins.

On the way to the entrance from the public car park you will find a themed sculpture that will allow you to answer the question.

They provide educational activities and field-based learning in marine and environmental studies. These activities include both incursions and excursions and the content within each has been designed to be interactive, entertaining and educational.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/9efba563-718e-4429-b417-f748ede82572" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Australind Bunbury Tourist Drive, designated as Tourist Drive 260, is a 14-kilometre-long  historic route from Bunbury to Leschenault via Australind.

There are numerous places of interest along the way and this Adventure Lab will take you to some of them.

Note the numeric answers to some of the questions as they will allow you to find a bonus geocache after completing all stages of this Adventure Lab.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

The City of Bunbury is named in honour of Lieutenant Henry William St. Pierre Bunbury (1812-1875) of the 21st Fusiliers. Bunbury carried out explorations in this area in 1836, and in a book of his letters and papers published in 1930 he wrote of Bunbury " A township has been formed, or at least laid down on the maps, comprising the southern promontory and part of the north beach at the entrance of Port Leschenault Inlet, which the Governor named "Bunbury" in compliment to me......"
In 1830 Lt Governor Stirling caused a military station to be established at Port Leschenault under the command of Lt McLeod, but it only lasted six months. Bunbury township was mentioned in the Government Gazette in 1839, but lots in the town were not surveyed until 1841, and these were declared open for selection in March 1841.

On the circular concrete surface at the base of the face there are circles indented into the finished surface on the vertical edge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/02bfc544-156d-4cad-a499-2bcc61ab7736" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the West Oz Geocaching Road Trip adventure taking you to some interesting locations in Western Australia.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

However, there is still often people walking along the beach and the paths.  Nearby is the iconic Bunbury Lighthouse that the beach is named after.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/bcbff0d4-3ac0-4509-80e1-a912db6dacca" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Bunbury.  One of my favourite parts of this city is Ocean Drive.  Ocean Drive takes you past some fabulous beaches.  Whether you like to swim, surf, cycle, walk or just sit and contemplate life, you'll find a perfect spot at one of the beaches along Ocean Drive.

So drive, walk cycle or even grab one of the many e-scooters available for hire along this stretch.  You will pass a number of traditional geocaches, earthcaches, cafes, a pub, plus many spots to access the beaches, or to sit and watch the water.

Maybe you'll spot a whale, or some ships lining up to enter the port.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

It stands some 25 metres above the ground and its light is visible from 27 kilometres away. The original Lighthouse on Marlston Hill served for 33 years until 1903 when increased trade created the need for a more modern facility. It was moved to its present site in 1971.

Near the walkway below the lighthouse to the west you will find a round mosaic that will allow you to answer the question asked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/9efba563-718e-4429-b417-f748ede82572" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Australind Bunbury Tourist Drive, designated as Tourist Drive 260, is a 14-kilometre-long  historic route from Bunbury to Leschenault via Australind.

There are numerous places of interest along the way and this Adventure Lab will take you to some of them.

Note the numeric answers to some of the questions as they will allow you to find a bonus geocache after completing all stages of this Adventure Lab.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Mangrove Cove is full of spirits and memories.  There are local legends about Anglesea Island.

The now deserted island is also known as Pig Island.  The story goes that an early settler herded his pigs there, to save on fencing.  They tried to escape by swimming back to the mainland.  The pigs drowned and Anglesea Island got a new name.

The waterway here became known as the Blunders, after the famous mistake with the pigs."

1922-1983

Mayor of Bunbury 1972-1983

Patrick Joseph Usher was a Army Sergeant (1941-1946) and former Bunbury Mayor (1972-1983). He was born in Yarloop in 1922. His father was a timber worker. Despite receiving a limited education he studied part time to become an accountant.

During the 1970’s Mayor Usher was instrumental in achieving several major milestones for Bunbury, including the town gaining city status, the building of a new civic administrative centre and the development of one of Australia’s largest community sporting complexes at Hay Park. A man totally committed to his role as the Mayor of Bunbury, he rarely missed a function or meeting. He went unchallenged a record 5 times.  Sadly in 1983, Patrick Usher died from a heart attack following a three month illness. 

On the back of the bust you will find the answer to the question.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/9efba563-718e-4429-b417-f748ede82572" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Australind Bunbury Tourist Drive, designated as Tourist Drive 260, is a 14-kilometre-long  historic route from Bunbury to Leschenault via Australind.

There are numerous places of interest along the way and this Adventure Lab will take you to some of them.

Note the numeric answers to some of the questions as they will allow you to find a bonus geocache after completing all stages of this Adventure Lab.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Wyalup means a ‘place of mourning’ as in the past the area was a Noongar burial ground. The waves plummet over these ancient and rare rock formations. Sunset time is the best, where the light creeps down over the evening landscape, providing a dramatic backdrop.

With plenty of facilities, this park and beach is a great family spot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/bcbff0d4-3ac0-4509-80e1-a912db6dacca" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Bunbury.  One of my favourite parts of this city is Ocean Drive.  Ocean Drive takes you past some fabulous beaches.  Whether you like to swim, surf, cycle, walk or just sit and contemplate life, you'll find a perfect spot at one of the beaches along Ocean Drive.

So drive, walk cycle or even grab one of the many e-scooters available for hire along this stretch.  You will pass a number of traditional geocaches, earthcaches, cafes, a pub, plus many spots to access the beaches, or to sit and watch the water.

Maybe you'll spot a whale, or some ships lining up to enter the port.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

In the town center, on a traffic roundabout, you will find this abstract sculpture.
It represents a boat and waves, and was constructed to commemorate the memory of a Bunbury resident.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/61bb6502-37b6-4311-96ed-7401fe9c8920" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Bunbury's first Adventure labcache.

This little tour of a little under 2 km will take you to some interesting artwork and spectacular views. 
Please note: there is no bonus cache as we are too far to maintain one.

Born in Bunbury, Western Australia, to Scottish immigrant parents.
He was the first premier of Western Australia (1890–1901) and a long-serving cabinet minister in federal politics.
Close to the bust of Sir John Forrest, you will find an additional plaque commemorating the St Paul's Anglican church built on this site.

Here there is a cafe, surf club, a super beach and a space across the road where you can camp in your caravan or mobile home.  What more do you need.

One of my favourite parts of this city is Ocean Drive.  Ocean Drive takes you past some fabulous beaches.  Whether you like to swim, surf, cycle, walk or just sit and contemplate life, you'll find a perfect spot at one of the beaches along Ocean Drive.

So drive, walk cycle or even grab one of the many e-scooters available for hire along this stretch.  You will pass a number of traditional geocaches, earthcaches, cafes, a pub, plus many spots to access the beaches, or to sit and watch the water.

Maybe you'll spot a whale, or some ships lining up to enter the port.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

One of my favourite parts of this city is Ocean Drive.  Ocean Drive takes you past some fabulous beaches.  Whether you like to swim, surf, cycle, walk or just sit and contemplate life, you'll find a perfect spot at one of the beaches along Ocean Drive.

So drive, walk cycle or even grab one of the many e-scooters available for hire along this stretch.  You will pass a number of traditional geocaches, earthcaches, cafes, a pub, plus many spots to access the beaches, or to sit and watch the water.

Maybe you'll spot a whale, or some ships lining up to enter the port.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

There is a replica coal skip adjacent, this was erected in 1994 in recognition of the miners who worked the underground pits from 1890 to their closure in 1994. There are two plaques, commemorating the relocation, affixed to the arch. A Memorial Wall stands nearby, this lists names of all miners killed on the Collie coalfields.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/7d7caf73-45ae-4d05-a666-7b934f22c356" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the Collie coalfields explore through some of the history of the Collie Coalfields.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Often, in early evening there is a food truck here so you can pick up a meal and sit at the nearby tables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/bcbff0d4-3ac0-4509-80e1-a912db6dacca" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Bunbury.  One of my favourite parts of this city is Ocean Drive.  Ocean Drive takes you past some fabulous beaches.  Whether you like to swim, surf, cycle, walk or just sit and contemplate life, you'll find a perfect spot at one of the beaches along Ocean Drive.

So drive, walk cycle or even grab one of the many e-scooters available for hire along this stretch.  You will pass a number of traditional geocaches, earthcaches, cafes, a pub, plus many spots to access the beaches, or to sit and watch the water.

Maybe you'll spot a whale, or some ships lining up to enter the port.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

The manager of the pools for years was Alby Timleris, I was always a little frightened of the large man at the front gate but Alby cared for everyone who entered his pools and made sure everyone was safe.
I remember one afternoon I finally garnered up the courage to go for a bombie off the high diving board, unfortunately, I didn't realise that bombie time was over and I was called over to the grass next to the office for 5 minutes time out.

Swimming was always made better when just before heading back to the club by purchasing some lollies or icecreams from the canteen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/bf292e1c-19f3-4fc5-9d54-d65eeedbb258" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BE AWARE: The airfield can be busy, especially on weekends, make sure you drive slowly and are aware of aircraft when walking around.

My childhood and youth are filled with memories of Friday afternoons piling into the car and heading down to Narrogin to spend the weekend at the gliding club. On occasions, summer holidays were spent in the town and its surrounds.

So many great stories were had here and in the town and this lab aims to share those memories with you.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

I was routinely brought into town to get patched up from various cuts and scrapes from adventures out around the airfield and surrounding farms.

Things have changed a lot in the following years and I will always think of this building as the whole hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/bf292e1c-19f3-4fc5-9d54-d65eeedbb258" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BE AWARE: The airfield can be busy, especially on weekends, make sure you drive slowly and are aware of aircraft when walking around.

It got to the point where orders were prepared Friday night to ensure that there would be enough for everyone.

I had thought this place had closed as I was looking in the wrong part of town, after a conversation with the family discovered my error and was pleased to see it was still here.
I had a chat with the original owner and although he is retiring at the end of 2022 his daughter and son-in-law will be continuing the tradition into the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/bf292e1c-19f3-4fc5-9d54-d65eeedbb258" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BE AWARE: The airfield can be busy, especially on weekends, make sure you drive slowly and are aware of aircraft when walking around.

My childhood and youth are filled with memories of Friday afternoons piling into the car and heading down to Narrogin to spend the weekend at the gliding club. On occasions, summer holidays were spent in the town and its surrounds.

So many great stories were had here and in the town and this lab aims to share those memories with you.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

The name “TAMMIN” means grandmother or grandfather according to the “Descriptive Vocabulary of Aborigines of WA” by G F Moore. Other theories are, that Tammin was named after the Tamma, a small animal that once inhabited the area or the Tamma bush which grows throughout the district.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

The name “TAMMIN” means grandmother or grandfather according to the “Descriptive Vocabulary of Aborigines of WA” by G F Moore. Other theories are, that Tammin was named after the Tamma, a small animal that once inhabited the area or the Tamma bush which grows throughout the district.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Albert Facey built this homestead on his farm at Norman's Lake in 1924.

Albert's homestead has been lovingly conserved and was relocated to this position in 2000 as testament to Albert's connection to to Shire of Wickepin's past.

The interior has been fitted out to reflect what life was like back in the early days.

Whilst here you can complete the 80 kilometre self drive Albert Facey Heritage Trail in and around the Wheatbelt town of Wickepin.

Take some time to explore the Albert Facey Homestead, and see where Facey spent much of his life, before travelling on to see the Wickepin Boarding House and the Wickepin Hotel.
Drive past the various farms where Facey worked including the Miekles, the Phillips, the Morans and the Bibbys farm. 

The trail also gives an insight into some of the general history of the area visiting Tarling Well, Tarling Hall and the Inkiepinkie School.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/8d9e6215-e093-4b60-b38b-ca79e7ab1af1" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the start of 5 wheatbelt museums around Kulin and surrounding Shires

You can do them in any order and whenever you are in the area. However you do not have to go into the museums to answer any of the questions. Check on the internet as to opening times as they may vary month to month.

The museums are:-
Alberts Facey's homestead – Wickepin
Pioneer Museum – Corrigin
Butlers Museum – Kulin
Australiam Inland Mission Hospital Museum – Lake Grace
Bluebird Discovery Centre – Dumbleyung

The town was first settled in the 1870s as a grazing lease and was later the site of a market garden. Yealering Lake was a valuable source of fresh water for the settlers. Community picnics and sporting days, for which the town became renowned, were held on the banks of the lake and in dry years horse races were run on the lake bed.
In 1907, land around Yealering was opened up for selection, and in 1908, the Yealering Lake Progress Association was formed. After the Government's announcement of a railway from Wickepin to Merredin, a townsite was surveyed and in 1912 the town was gazetted, and already by that stage included a primary school, post office and several other buildings. A hall made from local bricks was added in 1927.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

The town was first settled in the 1870s as a grazing lease and was later the site of a market garden. Yealering Lake was a valuable source of fresh water for the settlers. Community picnics and sporting days, for which the town became renowned, were held on the banks of the lake and in dry years horse races were run on the lake bed.
In 1907, land around Yealering was opened up for selection, and in 1908, the Yealering Lake Progress Association was formed. After the Government's announcement of a railway from Wickepin to Merredin, a townsite was surveyed and in 1912 the town was gazetted, and already by that stage included a primary school, post office and several other buildings. A hall made from local bricks was added in 1927.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

The Trimming family demolished the Inn building in 1934 and the stones were used to build the Arthur River Hall. The Kitchen still stands and is one of the oldest buildings on the Albany Highway. It was built separate from the main Inn building to reduce the chance of accidental fire damage. There was no running water when the Inn was built so water had to be drawn from the well which can still be seen today. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/6140f09d-8a22-4c9b-ad16-0f430e06d102" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The towns post office originally operated out of the inn. Mary Ann Spratt was appointed as the post mistress in 1866. The post office itself was not gazetted until 1892 which was the same year that the telegraph line was connected. The first telephone subscriber service commenced in 1913.

When the Great Southern Railway opened in 1889, much of the existing trade moved to new railway towns further east and many of the centres along the old "Coach Road" closed.

A bridge over the Arthur River was built in 1907 at Nobles Crossing.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

If the observatory is open, there will be a little further to walk to be able to claim you truly walked to the end of the jetty, all 1841m.

Look for the ramp leading down to the water.  Is there anyone fishing today?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/414b92a0-1c04-466f-97d0-642f5c5840e8" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Busselton Jetty is the longest timber piled jetty in the Southern Hemisphere at 1841m long.  Construction Commenced in 1864 and the first section opened in 1865,  The jetty has been extended numerous times until the 1960s when it reached its current length.

The jetty has survived Cyclone Alby in 1978, insect borers, several fires, extreme weather and the threat of demolition, to now become a major tourist attraction.

The jetty features a railway line along its length and an underwater observatory at the end.

Walking the Jetty has become a "right of passage" for locals, and tourists alike.  There are many fishing spots and places to jump into the water on a hot day. 

There is a small cost to enter the jetty.  Pop into the visitors centre first to book a ticket on the train, or for the observatory.  

You will need to walk at least one way to complete this Adventure Lab&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

O'Conner to supply the goldfields of Western Australia with much needed fresh water.

The Golden Pipeline Trail aims to use adventure labs to highlight some of the historic places and towns along the journey.

Old Doodlakine
The town sprung up due to the well sunk not far from here, it's demise came due to the running of the trainline.
Although today there are no buildings left at the original Doodlakine townsite there is still lots to see.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Construction Commenced in 1864 and the first section opened in 1865,  The jetty has been extended numerous times until the 1960s when it reached its current length.

The jetty has survived Cyclone Alby in 1978, insect borers, several fires, extreme weather and the threat of demolition, to now become a major tourist attraction.

The jetty features a railway line along its length and an underwater observatory at the end.

Walking the Jetty has become a "right of passage" for locals, and tourists alike.  There are many fishing spots and places to jump into the water on a hot day. 

There is a small cost to enter the jetty.  Pop into the visitors centre first to book a ticket on the train, or for the observatory.

It is the longest Wooden Jetty constructed in the Southern Hemisphere.
Cylcone Alby wreaked a trail of devastation in April 1978, completely destroying the Promenade.  
After a subsequent fire at the end of the jetty, damage closed the far end.
A Jetty Preservation Committee was set up and restoration projects have been carried out to what it is today. 
The Underwater Observatory Showcases the stunning underwater environment, the corals, the fish and as an added bonus, you maybe privileged to see a Mermaid swimming by.
There are more development plans in action and should be finished by the end of 2020.
A stroll out on the Jetty to see the locals and tourists fishing and jetty jumping, enjoying the experience is wonderful. 

There is a plaque at GZ.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/902ea194-af46-4e38-93cb-054668520576" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Meander from the Iconic Busselton Jetty, along the scenic Foreshore, down through the Cultural Centre of town towards some Local Historical Buildings.

Geographe Bay was named in May 1801 by the French Explorer Nicolas Baudin, he named the Bay after his ship, the 'Geographe'.
Busselton was settled in the early 1830's by the Bussell family, George Layman and the Chapman Brothers.

This Adventure Lab can easily be completed within a day, however I would recommend you take your time and explore the area and take in some of Busselton's Cultural and Early Historical Locations. 

There are plenty of stories to read along the way, depicting the Early Farming Settlements, the Pioneers and their Livelihoods from the Pioneering Days.

This features six life sized bronze sculptures acknowledging the life of the Aboriginal people as the traditional owners of the land, through to the early pioneers and industries that established the area as a successful outpost from Perth.
Here is one of the sculptures, John Garret Bussell, born in Portsea Hampshire, England, on August 16th, 1803. 
Following his gratuation from Oxford, John and his brothers set sail for Western Australia in 1829.
With Governor Stirling's encouragement they made their way to take up land at August. The land proved difficult to clear and cultivate.
On April 14th, 1834, John and his brothers arrived in Geographe Bay from Augusta on the ship 'Ellen' to begin the new settlement.
In 1835 the fledgling settlement was named Busselton in recognition of the achievements of John Bussell and his brothers.
Hats off to John Bussell and the early Pioneers&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/902ea194-af46-4e38-93cb-054668520576" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Meander from the Iconic Busselton Jetty, along the scenic Foreshore, down through the Cultural Centre of town towards some Local Historical Buildings.

which is the Oldest Stone Church in Western Australia.
This Church was built in 1844-1845 guided by John Molloy and John Bussell, work began on the church whose design was based on the Winchester College Chapel, in England.  
It was named after St Mary's in Portsea where John's father had been curate.  
Local settlers quarried limestone for the walls and hand cut jarrah for the rafters, arches, pews, and timber shingles.
On 4th March, 1844, the Foundation Stone was laid by Bussell's mother, Frances. 
The original building was consecrated in 1848, the Rectory was built in 1897.
A bell tower and bell were installed in 1902.
Between 1958 and 1970s the plain glass windows were replaced with the beautiful stained glass window you see today.
The closed graveyard, also heritage listed, contains the graves of many of the original settles of the district.

Busselton was settled in the early 1830's by the Bussell family, George Layman and the Chapman Brothers.

I am a shadowy figure who will make you feel uneasy if you enter my domain.
It is said, many paranormal activites occur within the walls of the old York hospital.
The Matron was right to say there were hauntings here.
The Nurses, when they were on duty, only went upstairs to the Wards in pairs, 
they never went alone.
The building was later used as a camp hostel, on occasions the camp supervisors have said they saw jugs levitating and move across the hall, it fell, crashed and broke into many pieces. 
I held the door handle, I turned the door knob, the door slammed shut.
If someone could find out my name, I might Rest In Peace.
Stand at this waypoint, and shine your torch around.

After you have answered the question, you might like to sit and reflect

The steps leading up the tower were made from wooden teak blocks dowelled together and placed grain-end up for long wearing. These step are still in good order and in use today.

The three keepers’ quarters, of stone construction, were built in 1904. The light was exhibited for the first time in 1904. The apparatus was originally powered by an incandescent vapourised kerosene lamp. The power was increased to 1,213,000 candles in 1924. The light was converted to automatic operation in 1978 and the keepers were reduced to one.

At least 12 ships have come to grief in the strong currents and dangerous reefs which lie off Cape Naturaliste’s sharp point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/9a1f8750-e3dc-47b8-b391-e919b7d37e5d" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Western Australia has the longest coastline of any state or territory in Australia, at 12,889 km (20,781 km including islands). It is a significant portion of the coastline of Australia, which is 35,877 km (59,736 km including islands). 

The earliest full charting of the coastline occurred during exploration in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries.

The coastline has some features or organisms that are found on the entire length, while some others are specific to particular coastal regions. 

Western Australia has some of the most remote and harsh coastline in the world.  The coast sweeps in a great semicircle, facing south on the Southern Ocean, west and northwest on the Indian Ocean, and north on the Timor Sea. It was one of the last states to be lit, with most lights dating from the turn of the 20th Century. 

This lab cache highlights some of the lighthouses along Western Australia’s coastline, the history and the importance of navigating our dangerous coastline.

Some stories say I had not drowned, I survived and was looked after kindly by the 
local Wardandi People. 
The local Wardandi People left on a hunting trip, upon their return, they found my remains on the beach.
You may visit the site my ship pulled up to at Wonnerup and see where I was lost in the surf.
During the calm Summer days, there are plenty of people enjoying the surf where I was lost overboard.
I have been remembered by the Vasse River and the new township of Vasse.
I hope you get to see my statue out in the new town of Vasse.
Stand at the waypoint, and shine your torch around to find the reflector, here you will find the answer.

I am here in the spirit of George.
I am the most commonly-sighted paranormal presence at this homestead. 
In 1966, I accidentally killed myself while I was cleaning my gun in a room at the end of the cottage. 
When a staff member at the homestead moved furniture in the room, they reported a constant banging sound until all furniture was back in its original place. 
Was it Me making those loud banging noises?
I like things the way they were, I wont disturb you if you leave things as you found them in my room.
Stand at this waypoint, shine your torch to find the reflector, and look all a-round.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/9df66400-852a-4297-98be-99c72d2b8f83" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Western Australia has a number of Haunted Buildings.
Do you belive in the paranormal? 
Maybe this Adventure Lab will change your thoughts.
Unusual sightings, cold pockets of air, or sudden movements of objects for no apparent reason, unusual noises such as knocking or footsteps. 
There have been many reports at a few known locations around Western Australia.
Busselton hasn't been known as one of the famous haunted locations.
Have you experienced any activity or what is your theory, please include these in your logs.
This Adventure is from the Ghosts Point of View,
now it is time to get into the Spirit of things and meet your first Ghost.

This is a NIGHT TIME Adventure Lab.
It is a short walk around Lou Western Oval, 
and you WILL NEED a TORCH to find the answers to the questions.
ENSURE YOU ARE WITHIN 10 METRES OF THE WAYPOINTS TO FIND THE REFLECTORS.
ENJOY.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

My name is Sister Maria, I am one of the most influential women on staff, and spent 17 years living and teaching traditional Catholicism before becoming gravely ill with cancer.
I wore a blue habit, and my ghost wanders around the clock tower every night at midnight; keeping an eye on the community I cherished for almost two decades.
As Australia’s only monastic town, New Norcia has its fair share of haunted stories, are you coming to visit me?

The main industry is agriculture.
The people of Wagin have a strong bond of civic duty and this is recognized Australia wide with the success of Woolorama which attracts up to 30,000 visitors to the town in March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/a530fa34-ca3e-4af9-a540-53a6a466367e" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The name of the town is derived from Wagin Lake, a usually dry salt lake south of the town. The lake's name is of Noongar origin, and was first recorded by a surveyor in 1869–72. It means "place of emus", or "site of the foot tracks from when the emu sat down".
The town itself came into existence after the construction of the Great Southern Railway which was completed in 1889 with the town originally called Wagin Lake.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Sculptor Andrew Hickson was commissioned to build the ram to commemorate the district’s role in the Australian wool industry. Measuring in at 30 feet high, the beast’s scale is second only to Goulburn’s Giant Merino, likely the biggest ram in the world. However, what the Wagin ram lacks in height it makes up in genitalia size. While the Goulburn ram was not built with any visible reproductive organs, the proud Wagin ram sports a rather impressive faux-woolen pair between its oversized hind legs. The big balls are a popular photo opportunity and while sculptural scrotums are not unheard of (see the Wall Street Bull), they are almost never featured on giant-size installation. The ram even stands on a pavilion so that visitors can stroll beneath its bulk and inspect its undercarriage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/a530fa34-ca3e-4af9-a540-53a6a466367e" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The name of the town is derived from Wagin Lake, a usually dry salt lake south of the town.

Campbell decided a massive jump in speed was called for following his successful 1964 land speed record attempt in Bluebird CN7. His vision was of a supersonic rocket car with a potential maximum speed of 840 mph (1,350 km/h). ... We can have the car on the track within three years."

Dumbleyung Shire president Gordon Davidson said the town received significant rainfall but those concerned were also excited by the lake’s condition.

“Initially the flooding ruined stock feed, caused erosion and damaged fences,” he said.

“But as the rain continued and the filling of Lake Dumbleyung begun, we realised this was a rain that could change our community.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/f140b888-9374-4a3f-86bb-f5b3cc3ad612" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One Year, Two World Records

The town was surveyed in April 1868 by Thomas Carey who proposed the name Bridgetown for two reasons.
1. As it is at a bridge
2. Bridgetown was the first ship that transported wool from this district.

Bridgetown is a timber and agricultural  town producing sheep, cattle, dairy products, fruit , nuts and timber.

Bridgetown has many heritage buildings from when timber was in high demand during the building boom of 1890’s. This lab will take you on a walk to explore some of these heritage buildings.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

The foundation stone is dedicated to the First World War. 

The hall was the venue for many dances and social events in Kulin through the depression years and into the Second World War with wartime farewells and welcome homes, and the annual Anzac Day service. 
The Volunteer Air Defence Corps, formed in 1942, used the Gentleman's social rooms as an observation post. 
The hall was available for free rent to local fundraising bodies during the war. Many fundraising dances were held, as well as many balls such as the Debutante’s Ball and the Grand Ball, and school concerts..
Currently serves numerous community functions.
Since its construction in 1928, the place has been associated with a number of community organisations. The importance of the place is demonstrated by the efforts of the community, n&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/3d18e99b-8568-4fc5-97bd-e30941c1da45" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

The Kulin Hotel had a controversial beginning when the circumstances of its liquor grant caused a furor in state politics. Since 1912 the Dudinin Store had operated as a liquor outlet and from 1914, a sly grog shop was available in Jitarning. In 1918, Michael Brown, who was the largest landowner in the Jitarning District, started on the construction of a two storey stone building with the intent of starting a hotel. 
However, by the time Brown’s building was complete and had applied for a liquor license, the Kulin Hotel had already successfully become licensed and Brown’s application was rejected. 
It was alleged that the member for Williams – Narrogin, EB (Bertie) Johnston had used his influence for his own personal interests. 
The findings of the subsequent Royal Commission were inconclusive and the Kulin Hotel kept its hotel license.
The Kulin Hotel was officially opened on the 1st April 1919.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/3d18e99b-8568-4fc5-97bd-e30941c1da45" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

That operation continued until the official post office operated from this building in 1926.

The architecture of the building is a fine example of construction during the Depression years. 

During the mid 1920's WM Butler &amp; Co of Wickepin established a machinery agency business in Kulin. 

In the late 1920's WH (Bill) Butler (WM's son) established in Kulin and took over the agency, developing it further with the construction of the garage on this site. 

The agencies functioned continuously right up until 1994. 

The garage has been restored and houses the Kulin Museum. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/8d9e6215-e093-4b60-b38b-ca79e7ab1af1" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the start of 5 wheatbelt museums around Kulin and surrounding Shires

They are made out of scrap recycled materials from the farms.

In August 2017, four of the eight silos cells were transformed by artist Kyle Hughes-Odgers, with artwork inspired by the local landscape and community.
The Merredin Silo Art was the 3rd Silo to join WAs Public Silo Art.
The artwork was rather controversial in the eyes of some the locals. The geometric style this artist is known for were not well received by all. What do you think?

Place of my birth and childhood memories. I hope you enjoy a small insight to the place I call home.

There are a number of relocated buildings on site.
The Bramley School contains historical school paraphernalia, many local photographs and changing displays. The Group House operates as a small museum and holds a collection of artefacts, dating from between 1921-1935.  The grounds are surrounded by farming implements, tools, renovated spring carts, an old dairy, a "dunny" and milk shed. These buildings offer an insight into the history of early life in the district during the early 1920s and the families that once lived and worked the land.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/7e6fef59-0fbc-4337-9fb8-20eeee93f9ed" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Wadandi Noongar people are the traditional landowners of this part of the South West region of WA. A group of white settlers established the town of Augusta near Cape Leeuwin in the 1830s and the Margaret River was named in the late 1830s after early settler John Bussell’s step-second-cousin Margaret Whicher.
It wasn’t until 1912 that Margaret River started to be built, with three houses constructed in what is today regarded as the town site. 
This Adventure Lab will take you to some of the European settlement sites in and around Margaret River. Most of the information for this AL was sourced from the website of the Margaret River &amp; Districts Historical Society. 
There is more to discover in the area so please visit their website for further information: https://mrdhs.com.au/locations-margaret-river

It was once thought that Zygomaturus became extinct about 45,000 years ago until a surprisingly late date between 33.3 ±3.7 Kya and 36.7 ±5.1 Kya is known from the Willandra Lakes Region in New South Wales, the latest known date for any Australian Megafauna. This is well after aboriginal arrival in Australia around 50 Kya

Since its bones have only been found in former swamp-forests, it may have been semi-aquatic like a hippopotamus, scooping vegetation into its mouth with shovel-like incisors.

Zygomaturus trilobus belonged to the now extinct family Diprotodontidae, which in turn falls within the Infraorder Vombatomorphia, a group also including wombats and the marsupial lions (Thylacoleonidae). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/cf9f9c76-bdd7-4cbc-9cf6-1dafe9694e41" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This lab will take you to well known areas of Margaret River and areas that tourists rarely notice or visit.

Settlers were asked to contribute one shilling a week towards a medical scheme to help fund provision of a doctor. Dr Rigby arrived in 1923 and plans were started for a weatherboard cottage hospital.
The hospital was built by May 1924. In 1929, extra nurses’ accommodation and the Margaret Cecil Rest House were built and the 1930s saw a new dining room, extra nurses’ bathroom, operating theatre and sterilising facilities added.
In the 1960s, the need for a new hospital was recognised and the Hospital Amenities Committee, community groups and the Shire Council began lobbying the government in a process that would take almost 30 years. Building started on the new hospital in 1989. The old hospital is now being used as a Community Centre.

The coordinates are taking you to the "Soup Kitchen".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/7e6fef59-0fbc-4337-9fb8-20eeee93f9ed" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Wadandi Noongar people are the traditional landowners of this part of the South West region of WA. A group of white settlers established the town of Augusta near Cape Leeuwin in the 1830s and the Margaret River was named in the late 1830s after early settler John Bussell’s step-second-cousin Margaret Whicher.
It wasn’t until 1912 that Margaret River started to be built, with three houses constructed in what is today regarded as the town site. 
This Adventure Lab will take you to some of the European settlement sites in and around Margaret River. Most of the information for this AL was sourced from the website of the Margaret River &amp; Districts Historical Society.

For nine decades and counting it has served as a centre for performances, meetings and social functions of both the local and wider community. It is part of the heart of Merredin. Its so beautiful inside.
I saw my first concert here in the 70's 'Sherbert' and enjoyed many other events here from Ballet to Weddings, School reunions, Repertory and many performers who used this place as a stop over on the  long road to and from the Eastern States.

Not only did MC Davies bring roads, rail and safe ports to the region, he exported five of his six sons to open trading offices on each continent (the sixth remained as manager).
Global demand for Margaret River hardwood was booming in the 1880s and Davies, who’d made his money supplying building materials during the gold rush while in South Australia, had the means to get it to market where others had tried and failed. So revered was jarrah that it was used to pave the streets of London and Paris!
The building had quite a journey in its 134-year history. In the 1950s the front section was moved to Farrelly St in Margaret River as a convent school and later sold privately. There it remains today as the main building of the Margaret River Motel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/7e6fef59-0fbc-4337-9fb8-20eeee93f9ed" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Wadandi Noongar people are the traditional landowners of this part of the South West region of WA.

It has at its heart a massive skate park for skateboards, scooters, and roller skates. There is also plenty of space to have a picnic and relax.

Before you ride, here are a few tips
•	The park is for all ages – 5 or 85.
•	If you don’t understand how a skatepark flows, ask someone who knows.
•	Snaking isn’t cool. Give your friend’s plenty of room and take your turn.
•	You can hit, or get hit from any direction, so always look around you.
•	Epic fails and falls can happen, wear protective gear!
•	Wear a helmet and pads in the bowl.
•	Parents and carers – keep an eye on your kids.

You will see kangaroos and a small waterfall at the end of this lab if you start at the visitor centre. 

This lab is not a long one, but it will be fun. Enjoy! &lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

PLEASE DRIVE SLOWLY as they are often just relaxing near the side of the road. Several large properties have made their land Kangaroo friendly. I have never driven down this road and not seen a Grey Kangaroo. Please respect the owners and do not trespass onto their property. You can see plenty of roos from the road. Enjoy this special place. 

The western grey kangaroo is not found in the north or the far southeast of Australia, and the eastern grey does not extend beyond the New South Wales–South Australia border, but the two species are both common in the Murray–Darling basin area. They never interbreed in the wild, although it has proved possible to produce hybrids between eastern grey females and western grey males in captivity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/cf9f9c76-bdd7-4cbc-9cf6-1dafe9694e41" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This lab will take you to well known areas of Margaret River and areas that tourists rarely notice or visit.

There is no reception here, so pre load maps and the app.

Built in the 1950s for the Bunnings Brothers, the thirty-five workers cottages, boarding house and club overlook the original steam mill, school, butcher shop and general store.

The village rests in country that was, for tens of  thousands of years, in the care of Pipelmen people of the Noongar nation. Nearby Noongar peoples, such as the Wardandi (to the North and West) also visited this country, following proper protocols that, today, are remembered through Welcomes to, and Acknowledgement of, Country.

Theirs was a strong, structured culture; they managed land, plants, animals, education and trade in ways that ensured they enjoyed excellent health and nutrition, and high levels of spiritual and social wellbeing. Their knowledge of and connection to every part of their Budjar (land, and all the life that grows from it) was thorough and profound. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/a4bbaae6-16b8-4dd7-a15a-aff6097da10b" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bibbulmun Track is one of the world’s great long distance walk trails, stretching 1000km from Kalamunda in the Perth Hills, to Albany on the south coast, winding through the heart of the scenic South West of Western Australia.

The Track is for walkers only and is signposted with yellow triangular markers symbolising the Waugal, the rainbow serpent of the Aboriginal Dreaming. Trail markers are spaced up to 500m apart.

Nyoongar people are known and acknowledged as the traditional owners and custodians of the land and waters over which the Bibbulmun Track passes. Nyoongar people have a deep spiritual, emotional, social and physical connection to “country” (Boodja). Nyoongar people ask you to please respect the Boodja when you walk the Bibbulmun Track to ensure its natural and cultural values are preserved for all future generations.

This Lab will take you on five towns that it runs by and is used as a break/restock of supplies by those walking the track.

Willmott became the first Head Lightkeeper of Cape Leeuwin Lighthouse when it was completed in 1895 and spent fourteen years in that capacity, residing with his wife and growing family in one of the lighthouse cottages, before taking up land at Margaret River.
Willmott engaged Yallingup builder Robert Donald to construct his house, a two-storey edifice with four rooms upstairs and four downstairs. It was built of local stone and locally milled jarrah and karri timber with a jarrah staircase leading to the upper rooms. The large central hallway occupying a two-storey space in the centre of the building was a distinctive feature of the design.
The house was classified by the National Trust in 1978. In 1997 the place was added into the HCWA Register of Heritage Places. Today Basildene Farmhouse operates as a hotel under the name Basildene Manor.

Patients were transported to Merredin by special ambulance trains. Merredin was located well inland making it a less likely bombing target. It was a rail junction which meant that casualties could arrive from various directions and it had an independent water supply in the form of the railway dam which would allow it to continue operating even if the enemy destroyed the Goldfields Water Supply pipeline. Water from the railway dam was pumped to a tank at the top of Merredin Peak from where it gravitated down to the hospital. 
You can either walk or drive around the well sign posted track to learn more about the ruins.
Near here is where the original land owners Njakinjaki (Nyaki Nyaki Noongar) camped in the bushland. Some of my childhood friends had Grandparents and Great Grandparents who would talk about their time here. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/3abdc620-6d7d-4535-914b-0d3179db3fb4" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Merredin 'The Heart of The Wheatbelt'. Place of my birth and childhood memories. I hope you enjoy a small insight to the place I call home.

 The town’s name is derived from the Aboriginal word “merrit-in” the place of the merrit tree, a eucalypt used to make spears.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

A railway to connect Albany with the terminal of the Eastern railway was mooted in 1880, but it was not until 1884 that a concrete proposal, put forward by Anthony Horden, of Sydney, to construct the railway on the land grant system, was accepted.
Mr. Horden was returning to this State to organise operations, but died on the voyage out. His control was transferred to the Western Australian Land Company, the work of construction being in the hands of Millar Brothers, of Melbourne, who commenced at both ends and proceeded so rapidly that the line was opened to traffic on June 1, 1889.
The actual junction of construction was at Katanning, which thereby received its first impetus. The township was declared shortly after the completion of the line, as were those of Mt. Barker, Cranbrook, Broomehill, Wagin, Narrogin and Pingelly.

Official recognition was given to the settlement to the east of the Perth-Albany road in 1861, when Sergeant McKenna, with his wife and family, was appointed the first trooper to the district. The police camp was set up at the waterhole now known as the Police Pools.

It has high social value as it was built for the Piesse family, an important pioneering family in the Great Southern, who were instrumental in the development of Katanning. In its heyday the house entertained and accommodated many important people. It was a prominent landmark when first constructed and had high aesthetic value.
Kobeelya was erected for F. H. Piesse in 1902, as the family’s private residence and built to overlook their property and the town. The name, suggested by Sir john Forrest is an aboriginal word, which means “place of sleep and rest”. It originally contained seventeen rooms; bathrooms with hot and cold running water, in-door toilets (septic), seven bedrooms and billiard and ball rooms.
The house is typical of the period with its gabled roof, wide verandahs, many chimneys, bay windows, stained glass windows and side panels, ornate plaster work and polished jarrah floors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/31f0a8f3-8c80-4869-ba26-d196fce31e3a" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Katanning, situated 362km from Perth and 185km from Albany.

The clock was built to commemorate the pioneering women of Katanning, and was unveiled in 1956 by Sister Elizabeth Grover after a year’s construction. Sister Grover was the oldest surviving daughter of William Grover, one of the first settlers in the Shire. According to the Heritage Council of Western Australia, the clock cost the town 1458 pounds, nine shillings and eight pence to build. A local jeweller and watchmaker, a Mr LFW Quartermaine, won the contract of maintaining and supervising the clock in 1955, for which he was paid 10 pounds a year.
   
Heritage Rose Garden
This delightful garden is located opposite the Town Hall and incorporates a Noongar Time Walk, Malay Mosaic, the Pioneer Women’s Clock and roses dating back to 1830. There is also a memorial wall with plaques remembering the pioneers of the district.

It was certainly the first to have electric street lighting installed.
The Mill’s founder, F H Piesse, recognised early on the commercial advantage of using electricity to power the Mill and began to gradually convert more and more of the Mill’s operations over to electrical power. The Mill was lit by incandescent bulbs from 1891 and by 1904 it was able to generate more electricity than it could use.
Starting with his private residence, Piesse embarked on an ambitious project to power the entire town of Katanning. Piesse saw the sale of power to the townsfolk as a lucrative business and had the WA Parliament pass the Katanning Electric Light And Power (Private) Act, 1904, granting them the ability to do so.

In December of 1903, a bill was passed in State Parliament to allow F. &amp; C. Piesse &amp; Co to provide electricity for lighting to homes and businesses in Katanning until 1964.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/31f0a8f3-8c80-4869-ba26-d196fce31e3a" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Katanning, situated 362km from Perth and 185km from Albany.

To guard the convicts on roadwork, military depots were established at Kojonup, Arthur, Williams, Bannister and elsewhere, the soldiers being recruited from time-expired men of the British army, mostly from India. These pensioners were made grants of land to induce them to stay in the colony, and thus became pioneer settlers. In the Kojonup district today, such well known families as those of Norrish, Elverd. Riley, Bagg, Newstead, Forsythe, Tunney, Noonan, Jones and others were established, descendants of their soldier forbears.
Twonkwillingup was an important meeting place and water source for local Aboriginals (Noongars). It came to be known as Police Pools after the area was used as an outpost/campsite from 1865-70.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/31f0a8f3-8c80-4869-ba26-d196fce31e3a" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Katanning, situated 362km from Perth and 185km from Albany.

In April, tenders were called for the construction of the Lake Grace Hotel, and plans were submitted to the Roads Board in June 1924. About the time that the Lake Grace Hotel was being constructed, the issue of prohibition was in the news, with the Prohibition Bill before Parliament, speakers in favour of prohibition travelled to country areas lobbying their cause. At a poll on 4 April 1925 the Prohibition Bill was defeated.
The Lake Grace Hotel was completed at a cost of £10000, and considered to be prestigious at the time. It open for business by January 1925, under the management of Mr E Tunney (Tunney Bros), who purchased the hotel from Bert Rose on 10 August 1925. The advent of the hotel signalled the end of the sly grog trade in Lake Grace. Owners, lessees and managers have changed over the years. Of some note is HV (Hariy) Carter who took over in 1928, succeeded by JJ Carter in 1934 (to 38), with HV Carter taking over again in 1946. Harry Carter was previously of the Bedford &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/ad8dda93-0f38-4315-9d74-00d3c028c121" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The area was first taken up for agriculture around 1911. In 1913 a school was established and named Lake Grace after the nearby lake. In 1914 the government planned to extend the railway network from Kukerin to Lake Grace, and local settlers lobbied for a townsite to be declared at the terminus. The railway was completed on 25 November 1916, and terminated close to the site of the existing school. The townsite of Lake Grace was gazetted later in 1916. The branch railway was extended to the ultimate terminus at Newdegate on 15 February 1926 and a further branch from Lake Grace to Hyden opened on 5 April 1933, making Lake Grace a junction and therefore of some importance for train working operations.

In 1922 the Reverend John Flynn visited the town to assess the suitability for establishing an Australian Inland Mission (AIM) hospital. The Western Australian Government agreed to subsidise the building of the hospital, which was subsequently built by AIM and opened in April 1926 staffed by two nurses,&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

On 19 June 1916, the railway from Wagin to Lake Grace. That year the townsite of Lake Grace was declared. A staff cabin and waiting shelter were in place at Lake Grace Station in the early 1920s. In 1924, plans for the new railway station, Stationmaster's house and goods shed were drawn in advance of the line being extended eastwards to Newdegate in 1926. On 1 January 1925 a Stationmaster was appointed to Lake Grace station. Lake Grace became a junction in 1933 when the line northwards to Hyden opened. On 24 July 1987 the railway station closed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/ad8dda93-0f38-4315-9d74-00d3c028c121" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The area was first taken up for agriculture around 1911.

We would walk to this establishment to buy and icecream or lollies ,back then it was like a goat track . 
Since then the establisment has changed hand the goat track has becomema road with a beautiful foreshore that many flock to for a swim,kayak,kite surfing and fishing. Whilst the mini golf and entertainment centre has seen better days the establishment has risen like the pheonix and become a kind of yuppy hangout. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/8ee60e45-60cf-4613-8de0-fa9bb99ee003" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have started this lab in an area that there are no others and to emphasis the uniqueness of the Southwest.

Nestled on the Lefroy Brook next to the Pemberton Mountain Bike Park.
The pool once had rail up the steep slope which you rode down in the pool. It also had a 5m platform (and a diving board) to jump off, and a small diving board on the eastern side of the pool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/4595632c-5318-4829-ae8b-01b558120734" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pemberton is known for it's tall karri trees. There are a couple of fire lookout trees in the region you can still climb - Gloucester Tree and Dave Evans Bicentennial Tree. The area has some beautiful landscapes and popular for photographers.

It’s known for the tall karri trees of Gloucester National Park, including the Gloucester Tree with its lookout point. Also in the park are the Cascades waterfall and Lefroy Brook’s rocky rapids. Just outside town are more giant karris at Warren National Park and vast dunes at Yeagarup Beach. 

Shortly after leaving the town the Track passes directly under the Gloucester Tree, in Gloucester National Park. In the past, foresters maintained a regular fire lookout from a platform sitting fifty-eight meters high in the crown of the tree. The Gloucester Tree lookout was built in 1947, and construction coincided with a visit by the then Governor General of Australia, the Duke of Gloucester. He and his entourage picnicked while they watched forester Jack Reynolds at work, cutting away branches to clear a space for the platform. The lookout, and subsequently the whole national park, was named after the Duke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/a4bbaae6-16b8-4dd7-a15a-aff6097da10b" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bibbulmun Track is one of the world’s great long distance walk trails, stretching 1000km from Kalamunda in the Perth Hills, to Albany on the south coast, winding through the heart of the scenic South West of Western Australia.

The Track is for walkers only and is signposted with yellow triangular markers symbolising the Waugal, the rainbow serpent of the Aboriginal Dreaming. Trail markers are spaced up to 500m apart.

Nyoongar people are known and acknowledged as the traditional owners and custodians of the land and waters over which the Bibbulmun Track passes. Nyoongar people have a deep spiritual, emotional, social and physical connection to “country” (Boodja). Nyoongar people ask you to please respect the Boodja when you walk the Bibbulmun Track to ensure its natural and cultural values are preserved for all future generations.

This Lab will take you on five towns that it runs by and is used as a break/restock of supplies by those walking the track.

At 53 metres in height, it is one the world's tallest fire-lookout tree, and visitors can climb up to a platform in its upper branches for views of the surrounding karri forest. It is owned by the Shire of Manjimup. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/4595632c-5318-4829-ae8b-01b558120734" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pemberton is known for it's tall karri trees. There are a couple of fire lookout trees in the region you can still climb - Gloucester Tree and Dave Evans Bicentennial Tree. The area has some beautiful landscapes and popular for photographers. Having been a regular visitor to the town for 40 years - I encourage you to discover it for yourself.

It was to bring water to the lighthouse for the builders and then later the keepers cottages. The wheel delivered about a litre of water for evert stroke of the pump that was activated by the wheel spinning. The water came from a spring in the wetland. This wheel has been like this since i was a kid and over the years has slowly but surely become more and more encrusted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/8ee60e45-60cf-4613-8de0-fa9bb99ee003" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have started this lab in an area that there are no others and to emphasis the uniqueness of the Southwest.

The remnants of the gardens and fruit trees for which Yerbillon was once famous can still be seen scattered across the landscape.

The pump stations were not just large, elegant industrial buildings dominating the landscape. Around each of them there was a vibrant community of workers, their wives and children, and often a teacher, all of whom established homes and gardens. Each pump station was like an oasis in the low rainfall region.

No 5 was the first of the smaller pump stations, with two pumping sets. To the west of the pump building were seven house allotments, although originally only four dwellings were erected; three engineers’ houses and a single men’s barracks. Others were added as needed. A second group of four houses, one of which remains, were erected later in Graham Street to the north of the pump building.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

The remnants of the gardens and fruit trees for which Yerbillon was once famous can still be seen scattered across the landscape.

The pump stations were not just large, elegant industrial buildings dominating the landscape. Around each of them there was a vibrant community of workers, their wives and children, and often a teacher, all of whom established homes and gardens. Each pump station was like an oasis in the low rainfall region.

No 5 was the first of the smaller pump stations, with two pumping sets. To the west of the pump building were seven house allotments, although originally only four dwellings were erected; three engineers’ houses and a single men’s barracks. Others were added as needed. A second group of four houses, one of which remains, were erected later in Graham Street to the north of the pump building.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Rumor has it that the ranger only attends one day per week. There are no powered sites for your van but there are free showers and toilets attached to the Swimming Pool (see coordinates).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/8443c525-557a-4048-818b-e4c4084eaee0" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This Lab Cache can be done in any order and has been placed to introduce you to some of the more interesting points in &amp; around Three Springs. The town has a reserve area between the railway line and the main road - and much of it allows for parking of cars &amp; caravans. 

The Midlands Road passes through the center of town and also holds most of the commercial businesses (Hotel, Post Office, Shops, Shire Offices etc). Other roads service towns to the west and east. All points of this Lab are caravan friendly - so if you're towing you can stay hitched. 

IIRC - the Midlands Road used to be called The Great Northern Highway, but lost that title when the Brand Highway was opened. Up until then it was the main road between Perth and Geraldton.

The mid 1880s saw the horse stables divided off as a lockup and a Court House office was added in 1919.Surrounded by magnificent lawns and gardens, the Plantagenet Historical Society opened the Cottage as a museum in 1968, furnishing it with artefacts donated by residents of the Shire.
The Old Police Station was occupied until 1908 when a new police station was constructed next door.
Other buildings include a Pioneer Room, Cottage, Stables, School House and a reconstructed 1870s house built of hand split wooden slabs and a complete apple picking shed has been assembled in honour of that industry's historical contribution and his and her "thunder boxes".

Recovered in 1974 after being under water for 70 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/ffd33a9e-f987-492f-81f5-ae0bb5dfc8cf" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The original Old Police Station built was by convict labour in 1868. The mid 1880s saw the horse stables divided off as a lockup and a Court House office was added in 1919.Surrounded by magnificent lawns and gardens, the Plantagenet Historical Society opened the Cottage as a museum in 1968, furnishing it with artefacts donated by residents of the Shire.
The Old Police Station was occupied until 1908 when a new police station was constructed next door.
Other buildings include a Pioneer Room, Cottage, Stables, School House and a reconstructed 1870s house built of hand split wooden slabs and a complete apple picking shed has been assembled in honour of that industry's historical contribution and his and her "thunder boxes".

Located behind the visitor centre, Horseyard Hill is a 2.5 kilometre walk through beautiful bush. In Spring there is a variety of wildflowers to see and lots of birds to look out for. I suggest turning right at the end of the bridge to ensure downhill at the end :) Allow an hour. &lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Unlike other ancient tingles in this forest, he hasn't been burnt outside his base although you can see evidence of past fires on his bark. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/b76a4c59-ced9-4d9f-97db-80f346fe9bf0" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  The Valley of the Giants is a family friendly, nature based attraction with guided walks, educational programs and a discovery centre.

The park is open every day of the year from 9am to 5pm.  If you wish to complete the Tree Top Walk, there is a fee.  The Ancient Empire Walk is free of charge.  Phone coverage may be a bit patchy.

 It is home to the famous Tree Top Walk which spans approx 600 metres and reaches a height of 40 metres above the forest floor.  

The Ancient Empire is an interpretive trail that meanders across the forest floor in between 400 year old tingle trees.   Much of the plant life in this forest is unique to the south west of Western Australia.  Trees such as the tingle only occur in this small area and provide a window to the past.

As you wander and marvel at this amazing area, you will come across a number of interpretive plaques which have the answers you seek to complete this adventure.

The Ancient Empire is a good example of the forest shaped by fire.

During our visit we spotted quite a number of them around the visitors centre.
The males are easily distinguished in the breeding season by their bright blue and chestnut plumage.
They sing to advertise their territory and can distinguish each other by their songs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/b76a4c59-ced9-4d9f-97db-80f346fe9bf0" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  The Valley of the Giants is a family friendly, nature based attraction with guided walks, educational programs and a discovery centre.

There are numerous sheltered picnic tables, barbeques, toilets and is partially accessible for people with disabilities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/00614976-5195-4ffd-bade-1a0ce855a2b4" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The massive ancient granite domes of Porongurup National Park rise 670 metres, giving exhilarating views of the landscape, especially from the Granite Skywalk suspended from Castle Rock.

A marvel of engineering, the two lookouts give spectacular views across the park and undulating farmland to Albany on the south coast, Mt Gardner and Mt Manypeaks to the south-east and the Stirling Range to the north.

The two kilometre walk up from the Castle Rock picnic area passes through jarrah, marri and karri forest and by Balancing Rock to reach the base of Castle Rock and the lower lookout. Reaching the upper lookout requires scrambling through and over rocks and climbing a 7 metre ladder. 

** You will need a reasonable amount of fitness (and an aptitude for heights), to be able to complete this Adventure Lab.

We hope you enjoy :)&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

A marvel of engineering, the two lookouts give spectacular views across the park and undulating farmland to Albany on the south coast, Mt Gardner and Mt Manypeaks to the south-east and the Stirling Range to the north.

The two kilometre walk up from the Castle Rock picnic area passes through jarrah, marri and karri forest and by Balancing Rock to reach the base of Castle Rock and the lower lookout. Reaching the upper lookout requires scrambling through and over rocks and climbing a 7 metre ladder.

Riggers abseiled into location to drill the anchor points into the granite before gluing and testing for stress.  The Skywalk spans were delivered by helicopter to the summit of Castle Rock and lowered by pulleys to the riggers to assemble. Stainless steel was used for the construction as it does not rust and tarnish the rock or leach toxins which might kill rock flora.

Other Granite Skywalk Facts ..

- The lookout at Granite Skywalk cost $1.5 million to build.
- It replaced an old ladder and lookout that had become dangerous.
- The new lookout was built to last with minimal maintenance.
- The height of the Granite Skywalk is 670m.

In 1895 Edwin and Charles Millar secured leases for 20,000 acres of old growth karri forest and built a number of mills on the banks of the Denmark River to process the trees which were felled inland. 
Millars exported the timber to Britain, China, India, Africa and South America from the port of Albany.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/1690ca58-73d6-4ff8-8e9b-64d4a0a08411" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Thomas Braidwood Wilson ventured to Denmark in 1829 and named the area after his colleague - Alexander Denmark.
In 1895 the first settlers arrived, including the Millar Brothers who had obtained leases on the timber in the area. Denmark was created to house the families of workers at the sawmills. Timber was used initially to build the workers cottages, several shops and the town bridge.
There was high demand for timber from Europe, UK and WA gold rush towns. Denmark at that time had a population of over 1000. However by 1903, all easily accessed millable trees had been cut down, leaving workers short of a livelihood. The Millar Brothers wanted to dismantle the town and move onto 'greener pastures' but the WA Government purchased the town 'lock, stock and barrel' from them and made it possible for workers to return and settle in Denmark.
Today Denmark is a beautiful, peaceful community whose economy is sustained by a combination of tourism, farming, fishing, vineyards and the arts.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

The largest city in Western Australia north of Perth. The city is located on Champion Bay, discovered by Commander D Dring in the colonial schooner "Champion" in January 1840. The bay was named by the Royal Navy hydrographic surveyor, J L Stokes, who surveyed it later in 1840.

The Geraldton area was first explored by George Grey in 1839. In 1848 copper and lead were discovered on the Murchison River. The first exports of ore from the Murchison mines was made from Champion Bay in 1849, and soon after in 1850 surveyor Augustus Gregory was instructed to survey a townsite at this place. 

On June 3 1851 the townsite of Geraldton was declared. The name was most probably given by Surveyor-General J.S. Roe, and honours the colony's Governor at that time, Captain Charles Fitzgerald.

Nearby to the city is the Mumbida Wind Farm.  Find the plaque dedicated to the opening of the wind farm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/02bfc544-156d-4cad-a499-2bcc61ab7736" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the West Oz Geocaching Road Trip adventure taking you to some interesting locations in Western Australia.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Albany has one of the most beautiful natural harbours in the world and a dramatic convict history.

Albany is the first European settlement in Western Australia and because of this, the area is bursting with history but also has unlimited natural attractions which draw many tourists to this diverse region.

Albany has plenty of interesting history, but one of the more significant, which is relativity unknown to the passing tourist, is the ANZAC connection.
In 1914, several convoys carrying ANZAC troops to Gallipoli and Western Front assembled in King George Sound. For many, Albany islands, rugged cliffs and brilliant white sandy beaches were their last sight of Australia. The Light Horse Memorial stands defiant on Mt Clarence and is well worth the visit for the views alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/a4bbaae6-16b8-4dd7-a15a-aff6097da10b" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bibbulmun Track is one of the world’s great long distance walk trails, stretching 1000km from Kalamunda in the Perth Hills, to Albany on the south coast, winding through the heart of the scenic South West of Western Australia.

The Track is for walkers only and is signposted with yellow triangular markers symbolising the Waugal, the rainbow serpent of the Aboriginal Dreaming. Trail markers are spaced up to 500m apart.

Nyoongar people are known and acknowledged as the traditional owners and custodians of the land and waters over which the Bibbulmun Track passes. Nyoongar people have a deep spiritual, emotional, social and physical connection to “country” (Boodja). Nyoongar people ask you to please respect the Boodja when you walk the Bibbulmun Track to ensure its natural and cultural values are preserved for all future generations.

This Lab will take you on five towns that it runs by and is used as a break/restock of supplies by those walking the track.

The buildings and grounds are situated on a site that overlooks the Princess Royal Harbour. The main building is constructed from local limestone, with a roof of split jarrah shingles. The hospital was completed in 1897, from the 1886 design of George Temple-Poole, and continued to operate until 1962. 
The site is also named the Vancouver Arts Centre Group for its later use as a community arts centre.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/9c50156b-3164-4347-857c-cc54aa19afa1" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Albany is the oldest colonial settlement in Western Australia.

It was founded on the 26th of December 1826 as a military outpost of New South Wales.

There are a number of Heritage buildings in Albany, and this Adventure will take you to just  few of these buildings, which are beautifully preserved. 
There are many more old buildings around our pretty town, so if you have some time, wander around, soak in the history and ponder life from a bygone era.

Originally the building housed municipal and commercial offices on the ground floor with the public hall on the first floor. The hall provided a venue for cultural and community events such as theatre, cinema, meetings and dances.

The building was listed on the State Register of Heritage Places in 1996.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/9c50156b-3164-4347-857c-cc54aa19afa1" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Albany is the oldest colonial settlement in Western Australia.

The aisle of the church is made from 22-centimetre (9 in) thick blocks that had been made in England. The stone walls are 540 millimeters (21 in) thick and the building also has stone foundations; the stone was thought to be quarried from nearby Mount Melville and Mount Clarence. The walls are so thick that no buttresses are required. The original building is now the nave of the present church, with the gallery behind built in 1852. The tower and porch were completed in 1853. The tower is topped with battlements on the parapet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/9c50156b-3164-4347-857c-cc54aa19afa1" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Albany is the oldest colonial settlement in Western Australia.

The Building was constructed by the Morley brothers in 1832.  John Lawrence Morley had served as a former sailor with the East India Company and was one of the first settlers in the area.  The cottage was originally set on a 240 acre block. The building was sold to Patrick Taylor in 1835 by the Morleys, on a much smaller block.  It stayed in the Taylor family until the 1950's.

In 1872 when the depot closed, more rooms were added.  From 1873 to 1953 it was the centre of the town’s social events, when it became home to the local government administrator, known as the Government Resident and later the Resident Magistrate (thus becoming known as ‘The Residency’)

After renovations, the building re-opened in 1975 as The Albany Residency Museum, the first branch of the WA Museum outside the metropolitan area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/ff8b4c43-765a-4a44-88fb-4d991c3f1415" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the Great Southern Museum Precinct, a group of closely located Albany landmarks and a location that is often driven past and admired, but not so often visited.

The features of the park include: a memorial wall, pier of remembrance, interpretive signage, lighting, landscaping, pathways and seating.  
A small area of the garden has been planted with Aleppo Pines, the same tree as found on Lone Pine Ridge in Gallipoli, providing a living connection between Albany and Gallipoli.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/380447a7-65e2-438a-a9e2-a791f67c8161" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the 1st of November 1914, Albany was the final departure point for the first and second convoys of ANZAC troops on their way to the battlefields of the First World War.  For many, Albany was the last image Australian soldiers had of their homeland.
Most thought they were on a great adventure.  Instead, they were fighting a conflict that many would not return from.
This Adventure will take you to a number of locations around our beautiful city which pay tribute to those who fought for our freedom. 'As the sun rises and goes down, we will remember them'.  Take your time to enjoy and explore the various locations you will visit.  This can take anything from a few hours to a day.

At each location, there will be a clue once you answer the question. The 5 letters (one in each answer will reveal a key word that you will require for a bonus mystery cache.

It was the base station of the intercolonial telegraph of 1875, linking Western Australia with Adelaide, thence with the rest of the world. It is one of Albany's most interesting buildings architecturally and historically. It was originally used as customs house, post office, telegraph office, sometimes for local government meetings, theatrical performances, debates, lectures, concerts, socials and even church services. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/9c50156b-3164-4347-857c-cc54aa19afa1" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Albany is the oldest colonial settlement in Western Australia.

It was founded on the 26th of December 1826 as a military outpost of New South Wales.

There are a number of Heritage buildings in Albany, and this Adventure will take you to just  few of these buildings, which are beautifully preserved. 
There are many more old buildings around our pretty town, so if you have some time, wander around, soak in the history and ponder life from a bygone era.

A bonus cache has been placed.  You will find the co-ordinates for this cache after the last journal entry.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

The original was irreparably damaged during the Suez crisis in 1956.  The masonry was salvaged and brought to Australia for re-erection on this site which for many troops who sailed from King George Sound in 1914 was their last glimpse of Australian soil.
The walk to the summit, lined with native bushland and memorials, begins at the carpark.
Behind the memorial, you will find the Padre White Lookout.  This is dedicated to the Albany priest credited with introducing the dawn service tradition to Australia.
You will need to locate a granite bench to answer the question. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/380447a7-65e2-438a-a9e2-a791f67c8161" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the 1st of November 1914, Albany was the final departure point for the first and second convoys of ANZAC troops on their way to the battlefields of the First World War.

It honours those who died in service or were killed in action in WW1, WW2 and the Korean War.
The trees are Swamp Mahogany and each tree has a plaque dedicated to a service person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/380447a7-65e2-438a-a9e2-a791f67c8161" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the 1st of November 1914, Albany was the final departure point for the first and second convoys of ANZAC troops on their way to the battlefields of the First World War.  For many, Albany was the last image Australian soldiers had of their homeland.
Most thought they were on a great adventure.  Instead, they were fighting a conflict that many would not return from.
This Adventure will take you to a number of locations around our beautiful city which pay tribute to those who fought for our freedom. 'As the sun rises and goes down, we will remember them'.  Take your time to enjoy and explore the various locations you will visit.  This can take anything from a few hours to a day.

At each location, there will be a clue once you answer the question. The 5 letters (one in each answer will reveal a key word that you will require for a bonus mystery cache.

Please Note:  No full stops are required when you enter your answers.

The City of Albany, located on the south coast of Western Australia, was officially named by Governor Stirling at the beginning of 1832. It is named after Frederick, the Duke of Albany and York, and the favourite son of King George III. The city is located on King George Sound which was discovered and named "King George the Third's Sound" on 28th September, 1791, by Captain Vancouver.

Albany was the site of the first settlement in W.A. when Major Edmund Lockier of the 57th Regiment, under instructions from the N.S.W. Govt. hoisted the British Flag on 21.1.1827 on the site of "The Residency".

The city was more often referred to as King George Sound or King George's Sound for about the first 40 years of settlement. Portion of it was originally named "Fredrickstown" by Major Lockyer in 1827 in honour of the Duke of York and Albany, Commander in Chief of the British Army. This name disappeared about 1831 and the name Albany was retained for the whole town.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/02bfc544-156d-4cad-a499-2bcc61ab7736" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the West Oz Geocaching Road Trip adventure taking you to some interesting locations in Western Australia.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

All the Australian States contributed to pay for the construction of a fort and the British Government supplied the guns.  The fort was opened in 1893 and was the first federal defense of Australia.  The site occupies an area of approximately 4 hectares.  Two gun batteries were dug into the hillside of Mount Adelaide. 
After many years of abandonment, the fortress was extensively restored commencing in 1987.  Eventually, the site became a museum.  Within the grounds there are many restored buildings, military equipment, batteries, armories and barracks.
There is so much to explore in this area, so take your time, and then make your way up to the Convoy Lookout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/380447a7-65e2-438a-a9e2-a791f67c8161" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the 1st of November 1914, Albany was the final departure point for the first and second convoys of ANZAC troops on their way to the battlefields of the First World War.  For many, Albany was the last image Australian soldiers had of their homeland.
Most thought they were on a great adventure.  Instead, they were fighting a conflict that many would not return from.
This Adventure will take you to a number of locations around our beautiful city which pay tribute to those who fought for our freedom. 'As the sun rises and goes down, we will remember them'.  Take your time to enjoy and explore the various locations you will visit.  This can take anything from a few hours to a day.

At each location, there will be a clue once you answer the question. The 5 letters (one in each answer will reveal a key word that you will require for a bonus mystery cache.

Please Note:  No full stops are required when you enter your answers.

The Centre overlooks the harbour from which 41,000 men and women departed Australia for the Great War.  It was opened in 2014 by the Australian and New Zealand Prime Ministers.
The museum offers immersive experiences with visitors.  You can follow the personal stories of 32 Anzac related characters, from soldiers to nurses, many of whom departed from Albany.
You do not need to enter the museum to finish this adventure, however; a visit is highly recommended. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/380447a7-65e2-438a-a9e2-a791f67c8161" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the 1st of November 1914, Albany was the final departure point for the first and second convoys of ANZAC troops on their way to the battlefields of the First World War.

Standing 34 metres high it was the first all steel tower built on the mainland of Australia, back in 1878 and is the only steel structure of its kind in Western Australia. It was was imported from England in sections and assembled on site. It can be seen up to 26km out to sea. A 320,000 candlepower group flashing light provides illumination for shipping.
With its bold colours, the lighthouse has become an icon of the port town of Geraldton.
This adventure celebrates a familiar structure that has been replicated around the town.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

A water course running beneath it offered brackish but drinkable water.

The Old Police Well was dug to service the newly constructed Police Barracks, Lock-up and Stables which once stood on this site.  The buildings deteriorated and were demolished in 1935.

An active railway line running down the centre of Marine Terrace, (now the Mall), proved to be challenging with pedestrians and other traffic.  By 1895 it had been closed and the rails removed.  It sat derelict for years until in 1910, saved from being torn down, it became the library which remained in the building until 1975.

From 1979 until 2000 it housed the WA Museum, when they moved on the building again fell into disrepair.  In the last ten years it has been restored and housed the visitor information centre until recently.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/6da70222-27e7-491d-82ab-bb449c046563" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discover Geraldton will take you on a short stroll / cycle around town sharing with you some of Geraldtons’ history which is often overlooked.

The theatre could seat 800 people and hosted both live theatre and films.

In addition to its entertainment role, a Radio Motors showroom and service station was constructed as part of the building.  The reflected both the growing popularity of motor vehicles and the increased ability of more people to buy them.

In the 1970’s the Radio Theatre suffered from the popularity of drive-in theatres.  At one point there were three in Geraldton.  

Radio Theatre closed in 1971, its seating removed, it became a night club for a few years.

In 2020, after being abandon for many years it suffered a large fire.  Luckily the exterior still remains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/6da70222-27e7-491d-82ab-bb449c046563" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discover Geraldton will take you on a short stroll / cycle around town sharing with you some of Geraldtons’ history which is often overlooked.

Here you can find many activities for the young and old . I recommend you start at one end and work your way to the other . There is plenty of parking along the way . 
In 2007, the Geraldton foreshore area, previously an abandoned railway marshalling yard, was redeveloped and today hosts a playground with water activities, public green spaces, public beaches, picnic areas, basketball court and shaded play areas. The project was completed in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

It is also the oldest surviving Western Australia lighthouse under Federal control. The foundation were originally laid for the Moore Point Lighthouse in 1877, but were found to be in the wrong place. Following this discovery they were relocated to the current site 5 kilometres from the centre of Geraldton. The tower was a prefabricated steel tower by Chance Bros. of Birmingham, and brought to Australia in segments from England aboard the ‘Lady Louisa’. It was bolted together on the new foundations. The light was first exhibited in 1878. The original original kerosene wick lamp was replaced by an incandescent-mantle lamp in 1911. A further conversion to electricity was undertaken in 1958. The light was significantly upgraded in power in 1962 when the candelas was raised from 90,000 to 320,000, the light was further upgraded in 1985. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/9a1f8750-e3dc-47b8-b391-e919b7d37e5d" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Western Australia has the longest coastline of any state or territory in Australia, at 12,889 km (20,781 km including islands). It is a significant portion of the coastline of Australia, which is 35,877 km (59,736 km including islands). 

The earliest full charting of the coastline occurred during exploration in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries.

The coastline has some features or organisms that are found on the entire length, while some others are specific to particular coastal regions. 

Western Australia has some of the most remote and harsh coastline in the world.  The coast sweeps in a great semicircle, facing south on the Southern Ocean, west and northwest on the Indian Ocean, and north on the Timor Sea. It was one of the last states to be lit, with most lights dating from the turn of the 20th Century. 

This lab cache highlights some of the lighthouses along Western Australia’s coastline, the history and the importance of navigating our dangerous coastline.

The inspiration draws from indigenous astronomy. Indigenous Australians saw different shapes and designs in the night sky, such as the Emu and the Seven Sisters and the Hunter, passing knowledge through the centuries.
Yamaji Arts has partnered with the City to produce and install the sculpture. The sculpture evolved from the interpretation of two paintings - The Emu in the Sky by Margaret Whitehurst (Wajarri) and The Seven Sisters and the Hunter by Barbara Merritt (Badimaya), selected for their aesthetic, cultural and historical merits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/0b1ae1a8-e434-452a-a142-a01c2a4c5571" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Geraldton foreshore.

The line to Bremer Bay was completed by October 1875, but did not formally open for traffic until the 8th March 1876 due to a lack of personnel to operate the station. Mary Wellstead, daughter of John Snr, was the first operator in Bremer Bay and quite possibly the first telegraphist in Australia, until the new appointments at the end of 1877. 

The first Bremer Bay Telegraph Station was built in 1875 from timber and had a shingle roof. However the original telegraph station was burnt down and the new telegraph station, which you see now, was erected in 1896. This time, local stone was used and the building became a well known landmark.

The telegraph station has been a private dwelling since the 1930s. It is currently operating as a cafe/restaurant&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/36c81093-73eb-4c20-b79e-149b14ad7cb5" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bremer Bay is situated 180km by road south-east of Albany within the Shire of Jerramungup. The bay, after which the town derives its name, is believed to have been named by the Surveyor General John Septimus Roe, who visited the area in 1848. It is assumed that Roe named the bay after James John Gordon Bremer, captain of the “TAMAR”, under whom he served between 1824 and 1827. 

Bremer Bay was originally named Wellstead in 1951 but locals petitioned to have the town renamed in 1962. The Wellstead family settled in the area in 1860 and held grazing land between Cape Riche and Bremer Bay.

This Adventure Lab will take you to some of Bremer Bay's historical sites. &lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

He and his wife Ann settled in the area in 1860 and together had twelve children.  John Snr. died in Albany in 1896, however his son John Jnr. continued the family pastoral interests in the area.

There is a Pioneer Gravesite elsewhere in the area (resting place of John Snr's daughter Barbara, and grandson George), however these coordinates will take you to the burial site of a more contemporary descendant of the Wellstead clan. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/36c81093-73eb-4c20-b79e-149b14ad7cb5" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bremer Bay is situated 180km by road south-east of Albany within the Shire of Jerramungup. The bay, after which the town derives its name, is believed to have been named by the Surveyor General John Septimus Roe, who visited the area in 1848. It is assumed that Roe named the bay after James John Gordon Bremer, captain of the “TAMAR”, under whom he served between 1824 and 1827. 

Bremer Bay was originally named Wellstead in 1951 but locals petitioned to have the town renamed in 1962. The Wellstead family settled in the area in 1860 and held grazing land between Cape Riche and Bremer Bay.

It is home to thousands of pieces of Australian history.

The history of the Wellstead family as farmers on the South Coast stretches back over 180 years.

The cottages were originally built from local stone, lime mortar sourced and burnt on the property and pit sawn timber also sourced and produced on the property. 

Boobook Cottage was built in 1854 and was originally used as sheep pens. When the second generation of Wellstead daughters matured, the largest of the pens was built up to provide a separate sleeping accommodation unit due to overcrowding in the house, and was then called The Girls Room.

The Currawong was built in 1864 as separate sleeping quarters for the second generation of Wellstead boys and was known as The Boys Room. After falling into disrepair and almost a total loss it was rescued and restored by 4th generation Wellstead and current owner Mr Max Wellstead.

By means of a white day flag  or a lantern at the head of the central pole the crew would know that there could be, for example, wool, tree bark or produce to be picked up for one or other of the ports around the south coast which they visited regularly. 

This service was phased out in the early 1930’s when shipping ceased and road transport took over. In the 1980’s the local Progress Association, together with the then active Tourism Committee, decided to reconstruct the cairn as something of historical interest. Building of the cairn was completed in the late 1980s albeit in a slightly different form from the original.

Locate and read the brass plaque on the side on the cairn to answer the question.

The area was first surveyed by the Western Australia Surveyor General John Septimus Roe in 1848 and he named the local range, the Ravensthorpe Range. Roe named Mount Short after the Bishop Augustus Short of South and Western Australia. 
Hopetoun is a town on the south coast of Western Australia.
Mary Ann Harbour was named in November 1865 by the sealer James Sale on the cutter Mary Ann. 
Hopetoun was established in 1900 as the port servicing the Phillips River goldfield, named after the first Governor-General of Australia, John Hope, 7th Earl of Hopetoun. The townsite was gazetted on 9 February 1901.
The town became a shipping port for the mining industry, with a jetty built in 1901. The railway line between Hopetoun and Ravensthorpe operated from 1909 to 1935. 
Fitzgerald River National Park covers 297,244 ha of coastline between Bremer Bay and Hopetoun. Please visit for the coastline and wildflowers.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Well worth the visit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/49b5cea4-10b3-4a1e-80ae-1ef79bb21fa4" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ravensthorpe is located on Highway 1 (the South Coast Highway) half way between Albany and Esperance
The area was first surveyed by the Western Australia Surveyor General John Septimus Roe in 1848 and he named the local range, the Ravensthorpe Range. Roe named Mount Short after the Bishop Augustus Short of South and Western Australia. 
Hopetoun is a town on the south coast of Western Australia.
Mary Ann Harbour was named in November 1865 by the sealer James Sale on the cutter Mary Ann. 
Hopetoun was established in 1900 as the port servicing the Phillips River goldfield, named after the first Governor-General of Australia, John Hope, 7th Earl of Hopetoun. The townsite was gazetted on 9 February 1901.
The town became a shipping port for the mining industry, with a jetty built in 1901. The railway line between Hopetoun and Ravensthorpe operated from 1909 to 1935. 
Fitzgerald River National Park covers 297,244 ha of coastline between Bremer Bay and Hopetoun. Please visit for the coastline and wildflowers.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

It is on Veal Street which was named in honour of Thomas and Sarah Veal.
They were on the way from South Australia to South Africa when the then Government asked them to stay in Hopetoun and operate the local Post Office and General Store.
They had two daughters Hilda Bertha Veal was my grandmother.
Hilda Parsons married George Parsons and had a daughter Sarah Kathleen Sylvia who later married Bevly John Furniss Burns.

A low level landing was provided in lieu of a passenger platform and there was no station master's house.
The goods shed was the former jetty warehouse.
Following the mining boom and then decline all railway personnel were removed in 1931 with the exception of the ganger who stayed as caretaker until 1940 when most buildings had been sold. 
The last railway property at Hopetoun was the turntable which was sold in 1952 after lying almost forgotten in the sand.

Imagine what Paddy would think now with a bustling street, a suburb in north-western Kalgoorlie and many mines named after him.  Kalgoorlie is wealthy town with a lot of the early money going into the many buildings that adorn this street. The Town Hall, the amazing pubs and the gold domed Court House to name a few.  This journey is all about Paddy and his mates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/b6d8d2e3-72f2-4ffe-a9b7-4ba99bca1adb" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1893, when Paddy Hannan and his mates happened upon alluvial gold near Mt Charlotte, no one could have predicted that, just a decade later, the twin boom towns of Kalgoorlie and Boulder would be home to the fabled ‘Golden Mile’, reputedly the richest square mile on earth and one of the greatest concentrations of underground mines ever established.

This adventure lab will take you on Paddy's journey around Kalgoorlie, the heart of the Goldfields.

It wasn't until Alan Bond started buying individual leases in 1980's to create one company and one big pit. It wasn't until 1989, the area was combined into one set of leases and KCGM (Kalgoorlie Consolidated Gold Mines) was formed. Take time to read the signs especially the one on Golden Mile History.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/b6d8d2e3-72f2-4ffe-a9b7-4ba99bca1adb" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1893, when Paddy Hannan and his mates happened upon alluvial gold near Mt Charlotte, no one could have predicted that, just a decade later, the twin boom towns of Kalgoorlie and Boulder would be home to the fabled ‘Golden Mile’, reputedly the richest square mile on earth and one of the greatest concentrations of underground mines ever established.

This adventure lab will take you on Paddy's journey around Kalgoorlie, the heart of the Goldfields.

There is a bonus box at the end of the journey too. Enjoy!!&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

The building is still being restored and looks out onto a sports oval.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/8b2e090c-0e7a-4a63-8ab3-64b44f62170f" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Shire of Cue is 120kms south of Meekatharra and 80kms north of Mt Magnet, right in the middle of the beautiful outback. As you make your way into town you are struck by the heritage of the gold rush town lying in every building along the main street.
Cue was named after Tom Cue, an early prospector who became a major figure in the town's development. 
There is much to explore around Cue and this Adventure Lab will only give you a small snippet into the town's very rich goldmining history.  
If you have some time, travel out to Day Dawn and Big Bell both of whom were once thriving gold mining towns close to Cue. Sadly, now only ghost towns to explore.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

If you have some time, travel out to Day Dawn and Big Bell both of whom were once thriving gold mining towns close to Cue. Sadly, now only ghost towns to explore.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Camel teams were a common sight in and around Norseman at the turn of the century. Not only were they favored by prospectors but they were also much involved with the installation and upkeep of the East-West telegraph line, undertaking maintenance patrols well into the 1920s. Camels also transported household goods and mining equipment, and played a major role in the fledgling wool industry on the Nullarbor Plain hauling wagon loads from inland stations to the coast of Israelite Bay or to the rail-head in Norseman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/2a334634-b43a-447d-8767-e1cd05cd766f" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Nullarbor Plain
As you travel across it’s windblown, barren surface you might feel more like you have left earth and are traversing the surface of another planet. 
Crossing this huge plain is a quintessential Australian road trip experience and the incredible vast landscapes will make you feel in awe of the wonderful Country we are traveling across.
The name Nullarbor comes from the Latin word “nullus” meaning “nothing” and the word “arbor” meaning “tree”.
Wombats, emus and kangaroos call the Nullarbor home.
Can you imagine driving for 146.6km in a completely straight line, without a single bend or turn in the road? The Eyre Highway is where you will find this curve-free road, stretching between Caiguna and Balladonia.
As you drive across the Nullarbor Plain, you could play 18 holes of golf along the world’s longest golf course – the Nullarbor Links.
Now as you drive across the Nullarbor Plain, you can add Australia's longest Adventure Lab the 'Nullarbor Links ~ The Aussie Way', to your journey.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

These wetlands are recognised internationally for their importance as a habitat that regularly supports 20,000 water birds, including several threatened species. 

Historically, the lake has been pink due to salt concentrations. However, it has not been pink for many years, but could well turn pink again as conditions change.

On 18th June 1841, Edward John Eyer and his companion passed this way on during their 1500 km journey from Fowlers Bay to Albany.

Its major industries are tourism, agriculture, and fishing. 

A beach and nature lover's dream, Esperance is blessed with squeaky-clean white sand, turquoise waters, untouched islands and colour-filled wildflower country. 

This AdventureLab will take to just 5 of the many wonderful places to visit while in Esperance.

Two turbines were donated to Esperance community, one of which is still in situ and the other, on display at the Esperance Museum. The remaining turbines were sold and sent to Queensland.  

On the edge of the car park, a large section of a turbine tower is lying on the ground. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/20f64421-e983-4547-9b94-aa514213cb1c" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Esperance is a town in the Goldfields Esperance region of Western Australia, on the Southern Ocean coastline approximately 720 kilometres east-southeast of Perth.  Its major industries are tourism, agriculture, and fishing. 

A beach and nature lover's dream, Esperance is blessed with squeaky-clean white sand, turquoise waters, untouched islands and colour-filled wildflower country. 

This AdventureLab will take to just 5 of the many wonderful places to visit while in Esperance.

Unique features include the largest sea grass beds in the world - providing food for the dugong (sea cow), the tiny cockleshells of Shell Beach, the stromatolites of Hamelin Bay and the dolphins at Monkey Mia.

Interpretive signage exists at the sites along the drive that relate to the World Heritage listing.

Visit the Shark Bay World Heritage Discovery Centre for information on the trail, whales, manta rays, turtles, sharks, fish species, walk trails and the World Heritage features throughout the Shark Bay area.

Specific interests of the drive include the stories of the early Dutch, French and English explorers of the area, the endangered species reintroduced with Project Eden, the views of Eagle Bluff and Shell Beach and the beautiful Ocean Park, Nanga Bay, Hamelin Bay and Peron Peninsula.

I had Telstra coverage at Stromatolites and Shell Beach but can’t vouch for other Telcos.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Its islands and shores are home to rich flora and fauna including rare and critically endangered mammals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/9c278d7b-88d6-493b-bb72-fcbd399c9e1e" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a short, walkable Adventure through the town of Denham in Shark Bay. 
Shark Bay is traditional country of the Malgana, Nhamda and Yingkarta people who have inhabited the area as early as 30,000 years ago. The Malgana name for Shark Bay is Gutharraguda, which means “two bays” or “ “two waters “
Denham is situated 8.5 hours’ drive north of Perth in the UNESCO Shark Bay  World Heritage Area. Captain Henry Mangles Denham charted the area in 1858 and gave the town his name. It was once a pearling port but now gives visitors a wide range of experiences from boating, diving, and swimming, as well as natural wonders like the dolphins of Monkey Mia, the stromatolites of Hamelin Pool, Shell Beach, and further afield François Peron National Park and Dirk Hartog Island.
This Adventure Lab can be done on foot in a short time, all being accessed from  Denham’s main street, Knight Street.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

They have belonged to this place for over 30,000 years and continue their deep connection and contribution to the life of this area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/9c278d7b-88d6-493b-bb72-fcbd399c9e1e" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a short, walkable Adventure through the town of Denham in Shark Bay. 
Shark Bay is traditional country of the Malgana, Nhamda and Yingkarta people who have inhabited the area as early as 30,000 years ago. The Malgana name for Shark Bay is Gutharraguda, which means “two bays” or “ “two waters “
Denham is situated 8.5 hours’ drive north of Perth in the UNESCO Shark Bay  World Heritage Area. Captain Henry Mangles Denham charted the area in 1858 and gave the town his name. It was once a pearling port but now gives visitors a wide range of experiences from boating, diving, and swimming, as well as natural wonders like the dolphins of Monkey Mia, the stromatolites of Hamelin Pool, Shell Beach, and further afield François Peron National Park and Dirk Hartog Island.
This Adventure Lab can be done on foot in a short time, all being accessed from  Denham’s main street, Knight Street.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Unique features include the largest sea grass beds in the world - providing food for the dugong (sea cow), the tiny cockleshells of Shell Beach, the stromatolites of Hamelin Bay and the dolphins at Monkey Mia.

Interpretive signage exists at the sites along the drive that relate to the World Heritage listing.

Visit the Shark Bay World Heritage Discovery Centre for information on the trail, whales, manta rays, turtles, sharks, fish species, walk trails and the World Heritage features throughout the Shark Bay area.

Specific interests of the drive include the stories of the early Dutch, French and English explorers of the area, the endangered species reintroduced with Project Eden, the views of Eagle Bluff and Shell Beach and the beautiful Ocean Park, Nanga Bay, Hamelin Bay and Peron Peninsula.

I had Telstra coverage at Stromatolites and Shell Beach but can’t vouch for other Telcos.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

In the same year, their first wool clip reached the coast, 130kms south.  
Wagons pulled by teams of horses made the arduous journey to Israelite Bay, where the bales were loaded on to ships for export.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/2a334634-b43a-447d-8767-e1cd05cd766f" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Nullarbor Plain
As you travel across it’s windblown, barren surface you might feel more like you have left earth and are traversing the surface of another planet. 
Crossing this huge plain is a quintessential Australian road trip experience and the incredible vast landscapes will make you feel in awe of the wonderful Country we are traveling across.
The name Nullarbor comes from the Latin word “nullus” meaning “nothing” and the word “arbor” meaning “tree”.
Wombats, emus and kangaroos call the Nullarbor home.
Can you imagine driving for 146.6km in a completely straight line, without a single bend or turn in the road? The Eyre Highway is where you will find this curve-free road, stretching between Caiguna and Balladonia.
As you drive across the Nullarbor Plain, you could play 18 holes of golf along the world’s longest golf course – the Nullarbor Links.
Now as you drive across the Nullarbor Plain, you can add Australia's longest Adventure Lab the 'Nullarbor Links ~ The Aussie Way', to your journey.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

This was the site of the first recorded landing by Europeans on Australian soil, when Dutchman Dirk Hartog came ashore in 1616 on the northern end of the island which now bears his name. He left a record of his landing inscribed on a pewter plate nailed to a post in a cleft of rock on the high cliff. Today, more modern posts mark this spot.

The Cape Inscription lighthouse - together with the keepers' quarters - was built between 1908 and 1910. It still operates, but has been automated since 1917. In 2012, the Shire of Shark Bay renovated the lighthouse keepers' quarters, which had fallen into disrepair over the years since lighthouse automation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/9a1f8750-e3dc-47b8-b391-e919b7d37e5d" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Western Australia has the longest coastline of any state or territory in Australia, at 12,889 km (20,781 km including islands). It is a significant portion of the coastline of Australia, which is 35,877 km (59,736 km including islands). 

The earliest full charting of the coastline occurred during exploration in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries.

The coastline has some features or organisms that are found on the entire length, while some others are specific to particular coastal regions. 

Western Australia has some of the most remote and harsh coastline in the world.  The coast sweeps in a great semicircle, facing south on the Southern Ocean, west and northwest on the Indian Ocean, and north on the Timor Sea. It was one of the last states to be lit, with most lights dating from the turn of the 20th Century. 

This lab cache highlights some of the lighthouses along Western Australia’s coastline, the history and the importance of navigating our dangerous coastline.

There is a book "Tales of dust and glory"
The club was formed in the very early years of the Carnarvon township, before the town was officially gazetted.  The club relocated twice in 1924 to what is now the current airport site and again in 1944 to the current location of Massey Bay.  In 1974 the well known North West Institution became the Carnarvon Race Club.
Billy Mitchell was a life member of the race club.  This honour is not past out very often. He was Clerk off Course, ex jockey and general handyman.   His name was Lawrence William Mitchell.  His family owned and trained horses, they came ins from the stations and driving trucks in the early days.
All his family were "hands on" around the a Gascoyne area.  Some brothers were Reggie, Johnny, Jimmy and Boyo and their was a few girls in the mix.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/5d64ffda-7dd8-4b44-8760-a705492fea80" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carnarvon is my home town.

Carnarvon Airport was originally built as a WW11 airstrip and first opened for passenger travel when it was transferred to the Department of Civil Aviation in 1947 and the original terminal was constructed in 1947.  A new terminal has now been erected but is a minimal facility servicing single airlines.
The airport contains 3 runways.
In 1993 the Commonwealth of Transport and Communication transferred the control to the Shire of Carnarvon.
Also a memory of me. My mother was the cleaner at the airport for the many years we were here.  On the drive across the entry to the airport, when it was gravel and every time the floods came through snd flooded passengers and works had to wait for a truck to drive across to ferry them backwards and forwards to the waters subsided

On 19th November 1941 was in battle with the German cruiser Cormorant
  On Nov 24th the Sydney fail to return and was eventually found 16th March 2008 
207 kms from the west coast (Seep Point). all persons on board went down with the ship.
A memorial drive was a grant given to put Carnarvon another entry or exit from town.   Unfortunately this drive fell into despair so the monument was erected on Oliva Tce.
The is a small statement of the Kormoran nearby.  There is a memorial to the Kormoran at the Quobba and 70 germans and 2 Chinese we spotted off of Carnarvon and the ship Koolinda brought them to Carnarvon.  
The men were then place aboard the Centaur cargo hold and transported to Perth

Unfortunately it is run by volunteers so runs to season times.  Please check before arriving
The museum focuses on two parts.  The Tracking Station and the OTC Satellite Earth Station
The Tracking Station was located 10 kms south rom Carnarvon or the NASA Gemini, Apollo and Skylab missions.  It was commissioned in 1964 and operated for 11 years.
It was the last station to communicate with space capsules leaving the earth orbit and the in contact before splashdown.
The OTC Satellite Earth Station and now museum was opened in 1966 initially with the 12.8 metre Casshorn antennae, or  "sugar scoop" form, which played an important part in television history.  It was used to transmit the first pictures live via satellite to London from Australia  
The earth station was expanded in 1969, when a second and larger antennae was complete, with a diameter of 97 ft (almost 30mtrs).  It took over the original antennae in relaying NASA communication &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/53c062ac-ed42-407e-85e1-aa62a4b26dfd" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carnarvon is my home town and I still enjoy coming home to see family and friends

It was converted from paraffin oil to acetylene  in 1909.
A new tower was erected by steel framework in the early 1960's, which was present and working in 1994.,
The original 1896 wooden tower was damaged by fire and replaced by the present steel sketal tower in 1962.  The lantern is now on display on the grounds near the tower.
Sometime between 2015 and 2020 the new metal tower was removed.   
a very short section and the stub of the lantern room remain.
The museum does open for the public if you would like a look back into the past, but you will have to check for times or enjoy an awesome cuppa and snack or ice cream at the 'One Mile Jetty Centre' which gives a few pictures of our jetty which was a prosperous life line to our town.  Also there is a museum connected to the area which is well worth a look.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/53c062ac-ed42-407e-85e1-aa62a4b26dfd" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carnarvon is my home town and I still enjoy coming home to see family and friends

The wooden float in the tank would shut the valve when full, and was ready to be delivered through a pipe on the jetty to ships, and with shut off valves along the jetty if needed in case of fire on the wooden jetty.  From 1912 - 1977 many state ships berthed along with livestock being transported by ship to Perth.
The water would also have been used for watering livestock in nearby yards.
The Koombana was one of the steam ships to berth at the beginning of the century.  Sadly in 1912 it went down during a cyclone north off Port Hedland with no survivors
There is a lot more history in the "One Mile Jetty Centre" with pictures and the information staff full of local info.  And the coffee and ice cream goes down a treat.  
There is also a museum of old relics well worth a look.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/5d64ffda-7dd8-4b44-8760-a705492fea80" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carnarvon is my home town.  I still enjoy coming home to family &amp; friends
Seafood to die for especially when cooked for you
Beautiful weather (98% off the time). what more could you ask for
I hope you enjoy your stay here too

This is a departure point, in chains from the mainland to their forced medical incarceration on the Dorre and Bernier Islands off Shark Bay, between the years off 1908 to 1919.
The story on this board is very powerful.   The two islands were separated the hospital and women on Dorrie Island and men on Bernie Island.  And for the next 11 years, almost 700 Aborginal men, women and children, suspected of having general diseases, were transported form the One Mile Jetty and incarcerated on these island.
There is a lot off history at the "One Mile Jetty Centre" and 'Gwoonwardu Mia Aboriginal Cultural Centre
I had heard of a bit off this story on ABC Who Do You Think You Are.
The island had been returned to native vegetation for fauna and flora.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/53c062ac-ed42-407e-85e1-aa62a4b26dfd" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carnarvon is my home town and I still enjoy coming home to see family and friends

The idea to build a meat works was conceived in 1895 but didn't happen until 1920. The meat works was built from handmade bricks by Dunkley and a sail trolley transported supplies to Carnarvon. Machinery was installed to complete the development but was never used.Then the area was designed to butcher and market the Gascoyne's sheep and cattle.  This was a success either.  
Then used for tanning shark skins for shoes wallets and belts.  Again another failed venture.
Then a marine products in 1926 to export smoked shark fins to China.  Failed again
During the Great Depression 1930's people lived in the abandoned buildings and then finally demolished around 1980.
Handmade bricks were finally distributed locally and recycled.  Some foundations off the metalwork site remain today.

Seafood to die for especially when cooked for you
Beautiful weather (98% off the time). what more could you ask for
I hope you enjoy your stay here too

It rises in the northeastern Robinson Ranges west off the Gibson Desert, flowing generally westward for 475 mile (760km), through gold mining snd sheep raising country, and empties into the Indian Ocean at Carnarvon.  It is the only place in Australia where the desert reaches out to the sea.
The original bridge was built in 1931 to traffic the people from the north to the south off the country.  Before this the only crossing was stout wire mesh and staked to the wide sandy river bed. and only when the bed was dry enough for people to travel safely.  
this is the second bridge as when the floods came through the water would cover the bridge and the side rails were taken off, so debris could flow freely..  And it was only a one lane bridge at the time.  On the right side picture you can see a piece off the first bridge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/53c062ac-ed42-407e-85e1-aa62a4b26dfd" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carnarvon is my home town and I still enjoy coming home to see family and friends

From the lookout, you can see out to the nearby mine sites, across the town, and really get an idea of the landscape of the area.
There are BBQs and tables here so stop, admire the view, and have a rest.

The Eastern Pilbara is one of the most isolated and inhospitable regions in Australia. Temperatures in summer time hover around 40°C and the hot winds blow in off the Great Sandy Desert. 
This adventure lab will take you to 5 locations around town. Phone reception is strong so you shouldnt have any issues here.

The sculpture is of veteran prospector Stan Hilditch and his wife Ella.

The couple accidently discovered the largest iron ore deposit in the world in 1957.

But despite the amazing find, the couple wasn't allowed to tell anyone about it for four years. Read the story on the information boards at Haul Pack 793B&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/fd5fe89f-02fa-430f-9eff-318d9e0eb70e" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Newman is the largest inland town in the Pilbara and provides accomodation and infrastructure for many surrounding minesites.
The Eastern Pilbara is one of the most isolated and inhospitable regions in Australia. Temperatures in summer time hover around 40°C and the hot winds blow in off the Great Sandy Desert. 
This adventure lab will take you to 5 locations around town. Phone reception is strong so you shouldnt have any issues here.
I would like to acknowledge the Nyiyaparli Traditional Owners, on whose ancestral land this Adventure Lab plays. I would like to pay my respect to their Elders past and present and extend that respect to all Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples today.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

It’s the second highest accessible mountain by four wheel drive in Western Australia and offers all of the rewards of a spectacular mountain view without the hike! When driving to the summit, low range 4WD is required. 
Look for the plaque near the lookout for the answer.

The wreck of the SS Mildura off the North West Cape in 1907 led to Vlamingh Head, a site proposed by a number of ships' masters to the Board of Enquiry.

Vlamingh Head Lighthouse is situated 17 km to the north of the settlement of Exmouth, overlooking Lighthouse Bay. The lighthouse is notable as being one of the few locations in Australia where both the sunrise and the sunset can be observed.

The lighthouse started operations on 10 November 1912 with a light that could be seen for up to 22 nautical miles (41 kilometres). The light took two lighthouse keepers to keep its light burning. The light used kerosene and flashed twice every 7.5 seconds. The lighthouse operated for sixty years up to 1969.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/9a1f8750-e3dc-47b8-b391-e919b7d37e5d" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Western Australia has the longest coastline of any state or territory in Australia, at 12,889 km (20,781 km including islands). It is a significant portion of the coastline of Australia, which is 35,877 km (59,736 km including islands). 

The earliest full charting of the coastline occurred during exploration in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries.

The coastline has some features or organisms that are found on the entire length, while some others are specific to particular coastal regions. 

Western Australia has some of the most remote and harsh coastline in the world.  The coast sweeps in a great semicircle, facing south on the Southern Ocean, west and northwest on the Indian Ocean, and north on the Timor Sea. It was one of the last states to be lit, with most lights dating from the turn of the 20th Century. 

This lab cache highlights some of the lighthouses along Western Australia’s coastline, the history and the importance of navigating our dangerous coastline.

Take a walk through the interpretive displays and discover the marine turtles found along the Ningaloo Coast. Learn about their lifecycle, the threats they face and how to view mating and nesting turtles and turtle hatchlings in the natural environment.

From December through to early March join a guided Turtle Eco-Education tour and scout for female turtles making their way on to the beach to lay their eggs. Towards the end of the season you may even be lucky enough to encounter turtle hatchlings as they emerge from their nest, making their way to the ocean to start their long journey to adulthood.

Guided Turtle Eco-Education tours increase the chance of finding and observing nesting female turtles in the natural environment. Viewing nesting female turtles and hatchlings with a guide minimises your chance of disturbing them which will increase the chance of female turtles successfully laying eggs.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Eucla is 87 m above sea level and located just 11 km from the South Australian border on the eastern edge of Western Australia. It is 1429 km east of Perth via the Great Western and Eyre Highways;  710 km east of Norseman; 491 km west of Ceduna and 1265 km west of Adelaide.
The old Telegraph Station at Eucla is one of the iconic and lonely images of the Nullarbor. 
It is now nothing more than a few old stone walls slowly disappearing under huge white sand dunes on the edge of the Great Australian Bight. 
A reminder of the isolated nature of this harsh environment and the way nature will always win against humans. Today, apart from the Telegraph Station there are the ruins of the old jetty on the coastline.
The Time - it will be different when you cross the Border.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/2a334634-b43a-447d-8767-e1cd05cd766f" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Nullarbor Plain
As you travel across it’s windblown, barren surface you might feel more like you have left earth and are traversing the surface of another planet. 
Crossing this huge plain is a quintessential Australian road trip experience and the incredible vast landscapes will make you feel in awe of the wonderful Country we are traveling across.
The name Nullarbor comes from the Latin word “nullus” meaning “nothing” and the word “arbor” meaning “tree”.
Wombats, emus and kangaroos call the Nullarbor home.
Can you imagine driving for 146.6km in a completely straight line, without a single bend or turn in the road? The Eyre Highway is where you will find this curve-free road, stretching between Caiguna and Balladonia.
As you drive across the Nullarbor Plain, you could play 18 holes of golf along the world’s longest golf course – the Nullarbor Links.
Now as you drive across the Nullarbor Plain, you can add Australia's longest Adventure Lab the 'Nullarbor Links ~ The Aussie Way', to your journey.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Karratha was named after a pastoral station in the area and was established in 1968 to accommodate the processing and exploration workforce of the Hamersley Iron mining company and, in the 1980s the petroleum and liquified natural gas operations of the North West Shelf Venture.

On the first of July 2014 Karratha became a city. It covers an area of fifteen thousand square kilometres and has a population of around 20,000.
Karratha has the expected facilities of a major regional area with shopping centres, health campus and medical services, both public and private schools, airport, restaurants and cafes, hotels/motels and an arts precinct.

The weather here is divine most of the year except when cyclones come through. Plenty of warm sunny weather to enjoy with the laid back lifestyle ?? &lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

An extraordinary colourfully Jasper Bar crosses the Coongan River. Unfortunately this Bar was mistakenly identified as Marble giving rise to the town's name. Somehow Jasper Bar just doesn't have the same ring to it!&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Built of local stone in 1895, it still provides accommodation for Government Departments.
Amongst these are the Police Station, Mines Department and the Courthouse.
We thoroughly enjoyed our visit to the Museum which is run by a very knowledgeable local lady. It's well worth the visit and is open from 8am to 2pm. Monday to Saturday &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/d9516bbc-31e7-4aa7-9c2d-cb381945d5c0" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marble Bar has earned the reputation as Australia's hottest town by experiencing consistently high temperatures during summer months when the mercury climbs to over 38 degrees for days on end.
The record is 160 consecutive days over 38.7 degrees recorded in the sweltering summer of 1923-24.
An extraordinary colourfully Jasper Bar crosses the Coongan River. Unfortunately this Bar was mistakenly identified as Marble giving rise to the town's name. Somehow Jasper Bar just doesn't have the same ring to it!&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

The name Ironclad is likely named after the Ironclad lease granted in 1891, and was the richest claim in the area at that time. Completed in 1892, the Ironclad Hotel had two rooms and a bar. Over the next decade the Ironclad continued to expand and change proprietors.
In 1914 new proprietors constructed a new building which was considered to be the most modern bar in the North West. 
During WWII the Ironclad was a rare but welcome change for RAAF troops based at Corunna Downs.
It was under the same owner for 60 years until it was sold by George Miles in 1966.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/d9516bbc-31e7-4aa7-9c2d-cb381945d5c0" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marble Bar has earned the reputation as Australia's hottest town by experiencing consistently high temperatures during summer months when the mercury climbs to over 38 degrees for days on end.

In one of the gazebos you will find a map on a concrete pillar, this will help you with your answer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/dddf275f-9ca1-4ea2-9275-813beac4b7c1" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Dampier, a small coastal port town in the Pilbara region of Western Australia.
Dampier is rich in history, Indigenous culture, mineral, marine and natural resources.
Dampier was constructed in 1965 as a port and processing centre for Hamersley Iron’s inland Pilbara iron ore mines. The port was opened when the first iron ore from Mount Tom Price was transported by Hamersley railway to Parker Point for shipment in 1966.
Five decades later Dampier Port is the second largest bulk export port in the world, shipping iron ore, liquefied gas, salt and anhydrous ammonia and also other cargo.
There are 42 islands off the coast of Dampier as well as outcrops and islets that make up the Dampier Archipelago and is home to several endangered species.
The Dampier region has over 3,700 hours of annual sunshine making it one of the sunniest places in Australia.

I ?? this town for it’s beautiful raw scenery, the sunshine, warm water and there is plenty to see and do around the area. What’s not to love

It is believed Red Dog was born in Paraburdoo in 1971 and named “Tally Ho” by his first owner Col Cummings. 
Col moved to Dampier and soon after Tally took off to fend for himself, spending most of his time at Hamersley Iron transport section in Dampier meeting John the bus driver.
And as they say the rest is history but for us there have been two movies made and the story of our beloved Red Dog is now world famous.

At the bottom of the memorial stone you will find some plaques.

The beach is made up of shells and pebbles.
You can view the famous ‘Staircase to the Moon’, which is a spectacular phenomenon in the northern region of WA, here occurring on full moon dates between March and November.

As well as producing liquefied natural gas (LNG), the North West Shelf Venture also produces liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), oil and condensate - a crude oil - for international energy markets.
The visitors centre is not always open but there is information about the project outside that is very interesting to read.

After the extensive reading of all the gas information make your way to the left of the visitors centre and find a plaque to get your answer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/dddf275f-9ca1-4ea2-9275-813beac4b7c1" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Dampier, a small coastal port town in the Pilbara region of Western Australia.
Dampier is rich in history, Indigenous culture, mineral, marine and natural resources.
Dampier was constructed in 1965 as a port and processing centre for Hamersley Iron’s inland Pilbara iron ore mines. The port was opened when the first iron ore from Mount Tom Price was transported by Hamersley railway to Parker Point for shipment in 1966.
Five decades later Dampier Port is the second largest bulk export port in the world, shipping iron ore, liquefied gas, salt and anhydrous ammonia and also other cargo.
There are 42 islands off the coast of Dampier as well as outcrops and islets that make up the Dampier Archipelago and is home to several endangered species.
The Dampier region has over 3,700 hours of annual sunshine making it one of the sunniest places in Australia.

I ?? this town for it’s beautiful raw scenery, the sunshine, warm water and there is plenty to see and do around the area. What’s not to love

The Nullarbor Plain is a place where you can watch whales up close, explore historic limestone caves, get views of surreal cliff faces, play a hole on the world’s longest golf course or just relax and watch the beautiful sunset over the Nullarbor Plain.
There is quite a bit of history inside the Old Nullarbor Road House, some interesting photos, the old fashioned cash register, the old fashioned fridges, even the old fuel pump out the front is an icon.

As you travel across the Nullarbor you can now add 'The Nullarbor Links ~ The Aussie Way' to your Journey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/2a334634-b43a-447d-8767-e1cd05cd766f" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Nullarbor Plain
As you travel across it’s windblown, barren surface you might feel more like you have left earth and are traversing the surface of another planet. 
Crossing this huge plain is a quintessential Australian road trip experience and the incredible vast landscapes will make you feel in awe of the wonderful Country we are traveling across.
The name Nullarbor comes from the Latin word “nullus” meaning “nothing” and the word “arbor” meaning “tree”.
Wombats, emus and kangaroos call the Nullarbor home.
Can you imagine driving for 146.6km in a completely straight line, without a single bend or turn in the road? The Eyre Highway is where you will find this curve-free road, stretching between Caiguna and Balladonia.
As you drive across the Nullarbor Plain, you could play 18 holes of golf along the world’s longest golf course – the Nullarbor Links.
Now as you drive across the Nullarbor Plain, you can add Australia's longest Adventure Lab the 'Nullarbor Links ~ The Aussie Way', to your journey.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

The township of Penong is a small wheatbelt settlement on the western edge of South Australia's wheatbelt which is characterised by dozens of windmills which pump the local water supply from a large underground basin, the Anjutabie water Basin. 
Around the back of the town on the northern side, the historical society has been busy restoring an amazing number of old windmills, some with their history is documented on the information boards. 
The Large Comet Windmill has a colourful history and is now well preserved.
The town and the surrounding district is so dry that the underground water is supplemented by rain water and water which is carted by truck from a reticulated water supply connected to the Tod River pipeline some 15 kilometres east of Penong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/2a334634-b43a-447d-8767-e1cd05cd766f" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Nullarbor Plain

They wore cumbersome full dive suits made of canvas with copper helmets and lead weighted boots which enabled them to  dive in very deep waters.
At the cemetery, obelisks mark the graves of over 900 Japanese pearlers. Most died due to decompression sickness or other illnesses related to diving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/d2ad1127-ffe2-4a9c-a2f7-84653d30f0bf" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first recorded European to land on Broome shores was explorer William Dampier aboard his ship the HMS Roebuck.
The town was founded in 1883 as a port for the pearling industry and was named after the then Governor of WA – Sir Frederick Broome. 
Although today, Broome is famous for it's beautiful pearls, originally Broome made it's name from the shells - not the pearls. From the 1880's, mother of pearl (the shell) was used to make buttons, cutlery handles, inlays and other ornate objects but with the introduction of plastic in the 1900's, mother of pearl became too expensive to use. The local economy collapsed and it would take until the mid 1950's before the pearl industry was revitalised and since has developed into the booming industry it has become.
This historic pearling town in now one of the most favourite holiday destinations in the country.

In 1913, Master Pearler Ted Hunter purchased the building and converted it into a 500 seat outdoor picture theatre, opening with a silent movie in December 1916.
Over the years Sun Pictures has had a succession of owners and is significant as the world's oldest outdoor picture garden.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/d2ad1127-ffe2-4a9c-a2f7-84653d30f0bf" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first recorded European to land on Broome shores was explorer William Dampier aboard his ship the HMS Roebuck.
The town was founded in 1883 as a port for the pearling industry and was named after the then Governor of WA – Sir Frederick Broome. 
Although today, Broome is famous for it's beautiful pearls, originally Broome made it's name from the shells - not the pearls. From the 1880's, mother of pearl (the shell) was used to make buttons, cutlery handles, inlays and other ornate objects but with the introduction of plastic in the 1900's, mother of pearl became too expensive to use. The local economy collapsed and it would take until the mid 1950's before the pearl industry was revitalised and since has developed into the booming industry it has become.
This historic pearling town in now one of the most favourite holiday destinations in the country.

In the 1980's he invested millions of dollars in Broome, opening a zoo and saving and restoring many of Broome's historical buildings including Sun Picture House and constructing Cable Beach Resort.

The tower is 13.1m high. Cape Leveque lighthouse was commissioned on 9 August 1911, and was one of ten lighthouses built on the West Australian coast between 1900 and 1913, most of them on the North West coast. 

Cape Leveque lighthouse tower was manufactured in Perth. Construction of the lighthouse and associated quarters cost £9,219. The lighthouse was fitted with a third order, dioptric triple flashing white light, which was visible for 18 nautical miles in fine weather. The light was fuelled by kerosene and the lighthouse was manned by two light keepers. The tower is the only prefabricated cast iron lighthouse designed by the Public Works Department and manufactured locally by Bela Makutz .

The RAAF had a base near the lighthouse during World War Two, and an airstrip was built nearby in 1955. The lighthouse was modernised in 1965/66 with a new light and a non-directional radio beacon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Adventure Lab Descriptions&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gsmediadata.blob.core.windows.net/mediacontainer/9a1f8750-e3dc-47b8-b391-e919b7d37e5d" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Western Australia has the longest coastline of any state or territory in Australia, at 12,889 km (20,781 km including islands). It is a significant portion of the coastline of Australia, which is 35,877 km (59,736 km including islands). 

The earliest full charting of the coastline occurred during exploration in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries.

The coastline has some features or organisms that are found on the entire length, while some others are specific to particular coastal regions. 

Western Australia has some of the most remote and harsh coastline in the world.  The coast sweeps in a great semicircle, facing south on the Southern Ocean, west and northwest on the Indian Ocean, and north on the Timor Sea. It was one of the last states to be lit, with most lights dating from the turn of the 20th Century. 

This lab cache highlights some of the lighthouses along Western Australia’s coastline, the history and the importance of navigating our dangerous coastline.
