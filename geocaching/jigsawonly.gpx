Photo-Play, ullyssia and I teamed up to complete the 4WD series that we had started in December. We picked up the one that was missing last time and also got to a few traditionals along the way. All caches were quick finds and we signed the logs as P U P-P. It was a nice drive through this beautiful forest and great to have the full geo-art showing on our maps now! The timing was perfect as we collected many of the new Wonders as well. We also took the opportunity to pick up some rubbish for the Locationless cache  .</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">An excellent day of caching in the forest. I didn’t think it was going to be as hot but the temperature gauge bounced between 39-40C for most of the day.

I ended up with 90 finds for the day before negotiating the rabbit warren of tracks back to Yarra Rd.

Photo-Play, ullyssia and I teamed up to complete the 4WD series that we had started in December. We picked up the one that was missing last time and also got to a few traditionals along the way. All caches were quick finds and we signed the logs as P U P-P. It was a nice drive through this beautiful forest and great to have the full geo-art showing on our maps now! The timing was perfect as we collected many of the new Wonders as well. We also took the opportunity to pick up some rubbish for the Locationless cache  .</groundspeak:text>

I ended up with 90 finds for the day before negotiating the rabbit warren of tracks back to Yarra Rd.

Photo-Play, ullyssia and I teamed up to complete the 4WD series that we had started in December. We picked up the one that was missing last time and also got to a few traditionals along the way. All caches were quick finds and we signed the logs as P U P-P. It was a nice drive through this beautiful forest and great to have the full geo-art showing on our maps now! The timing was perfect as we collected many of the new Wonders as well. We also took the opportunity to pick up some rubbish for the Locationless cache  .</groundspeak:text>

After doing half of them by the time we had lunch we decided to continue and see if we could do them all today so it ended up being a full day of caching doing them all.

All caches found without too much searching although whoever pushed some of the containers right into the ground and/or mulch didn't realise that they would be covered over by insect activity making them all but impossible to find without reference to the hints.

Logs signed and caches returned as found (except for the buried ones which were left out of the ground/mulch.

I enjoyed travelling along the tracks, admiring the views at the top of the various hills, seeing the vegetation change at the bottom, and checking out some nice granite outcrops.
I thought we might get half of the series done, but was super happy when we managed to find 151 of the FOTTs, and a nearby traditional.  All caches were in good condition, and most were found without too much trouble, though we did have one DNF which I hope to rectify at some point, perhaps when we head back to complete the series.</groundspeak:text>

Photo-Play, ullyssia and I teamed up to start this series and we had a successful day with 152 finds over 8hrs of caching (plus 3hrs driving there and back), our best daily achievement. This is also over a quarter of my finds for the year in one day!
We picked the day a few weeks ago and we were lucky to enjoy perfect conditions weather-wise. All caches were quick finds except for 1 DNF. We took turns driving and finding, and signed the logs as P U P-P. We started at the eastern end to fill a few spots on our D/T grids and zig-zagged our way back towards the NW corner.
We really enjoyed driving through this beautiful forest. We disturbed several kangaroos and a rabbit along the way, and only came across one other car. There were quite a few trees laying across the roads but most of them already had a by-pass track. We had to make our own way through the bush for a couple but it was nothing that Photo-Play’s 4WD could not handle. 
Will be back to finish off the series!</groundspeak:text>

I enjoyed travelling along the tracks, admiring the views at the top of the various hills, seeing the vegetation change at the bottom, and checking out some nice granite outcrops.
I thought we might get half of the series done, but was super happy when we managed to find 151 of the FOTTs, and a nearby traditional.  All caches were in good condition, and most were found without too much trouble, though we did have one DNF which I hope to rectify at some point, perhaps when we head back to complete the series.</groundspeak:text>

Signed the log as “PUPP” (papillon367, ullyssia and Photo-Play) We joined up and formed a gang to tackle this series. Planning was a few weeks prior so we put our order in for perfect weather. It was a great drive through this area and nice to get up close to a few of the locals. Most caches were quick finds except one. The track was acceptable with a few obstacles and detours. Although we are not complete, this is a fantastic series with about 150 completed today. We’ll be back to finish off. Thanks for bringing us to this area.

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">A quick find here. Thank you for the cache and for the fun series Fellowship Of The Trail! Apologies for the generic logs…
Photo-Play, ullyssia and I teamed up to start this series and we had a successful day with 152 finds over 8hrs of caching (plus 3hrs driving there and back), our best daily achievement. This is also over a quarter of my finds for the year in one day!
We picked the day a few weeks ago and we were lucky to enjoy perfect conditions weather-wise. All caches were quick finds except for 1 DNF. We took turns driving and finding, and signed the logs as P U P-P. We started at the eastern end to fill a few spots on our D/T grids and zig-zagged our way back towards the NW corner.
We really enjoyed driving through this beautiful forest. We disturbed several kangaroos and a rabbit along the way, and only came across one other car. There were quite a few trees laying across the roads but most of them already had a by-pass track. We had to make our own way through the bush for a couple but it was nothing that Photo-Play’s 4WD could not handle. 
Will be back to finish off the series!</groundspeak:text>

After doing half of them by the time we had lunch we decided to continue and see if we could do them all today so it ended up being a full day of caching doing them all.

All caches found without too much searching although whoever pushed some of the containers right into the ground and/or mulch didn't realise that they would be covered over by insect activity making them all but impossible to find without reference to the hints.

Logs signed and caches returned as found (except for the buried ones which were left out of the ground/mulch.

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">A quick find here. Thank you for the cache and for the fun series Fellowship Of The Trail! Apologies for the generic logs…
Photo-Play, ullyssia and I teamed up to start this series and we had a successful day with 152 finds over 8hrs of caching (plus 3hrs driving there and back), our best daily achievement. This is also over a quarter of my finds for the year in one day!
We picked the day a few weeks ago and we were lucky to enjoy perfect conditions weather-wise. All caches were quick finds except for 1 DNF. We took turns driving and finding, and signed the logs as P U P-P. We started at the eastern end to fill a few spots on our D/T grids and zig-zagged our way back towards the NW corner.
We really enjoyed driving through this beautiful forest. We disturbed several kangaroos and a rabbit along the way, and only came across one other car. There were quite a few trees laying across the roads but most of them already had a by-pass track. We had to make our own way through the bush for a couple but it was nothing that Photo-Play’s 4WD could not handle. 
Will be back to finish off the series!</groundspeak:text>

After doing half of them by the time we had lunch we decided to continue and see if we could do them all today so it ended up being a full day of caching doing them all.

All caches found without too much searching although whoever pushed some of the containers right into the ground and/or mulch didn't realise that they would be covered over by insect activity making them all but impossible to find without reference to the hints.

Logs signed and caches returned as found (except for the buried ones which were left out of the ground/mulch.

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Thank you!  The PUPP team (papillon367, ullyssia and Photo-Play) headed out on a rather nice summer's day to tackle the FOTT.  I enjoyed travelling along the tracks, admiring the views at the top of the various hills, seeing the vegetation change at the bottom, and checking out some nice granite outcrops.
I thought we might get half of the series done, but was super happy when we managed to find 151 of the FOTTs, and a nearby traditional.  All caches were in good condition, and most were found without too much trouble, though we did have one DNF which I hope to rectify at some point, perhaps when we head back to complete the series.</groundspeak:text>

Signed the log as “PUPP” (papillon367, ullyssia and Photo-Play) We joined up and formed a gang to tackle this series. Planning was a few weeks prior so we put our order in for perfect weather. It was a great drive through this area and nice to get up close to a few of the locals. Most caches were quick finds except one. The track was acceptable with a few obstacles and detours. Although we are not complete, this is a fantastic series with about 150 completed today. We’ll be back to finish off. Thanks for bringing us to this area.

Photo-Play, ullyssia and I teamed up to complete the 4WD series that we had started in December. We picked up the one that was missing last time and also got to a few traditionals along the way. All caches were quick finds and we signed the logs as P U P-P. It was a nice drive through this beautiful forest and great to have the full geo-art showing on our maps now! The timing was perfect as we collected many of the new Wonders as well. We also took the opportunity to pick up some rubbish for the Locationless cache  .</groundspeak:text>

I enjoyed travelling along the tracks, admiring the views at the top of the various hills, seeing the vegetation change at the bottom, and checking out some nice granite outcrops.
I thought we might get half of the series done, but was super happy when we managed to find 151 of the FOTTs, and a nearby traditional.  All caches were in good condition, and most were found without too much trouble, though we did have one DNF which I hope to rectify at some point, perhaps when we head back to complete the series.</groundspeak:text>

Photo-Play, ullyssia and I teamed up to start this series and we had a successful day with 152 finds over 8hrs of caching (plus 3hrs driving there and back), our best daily achievement. This is also over a quarter of my finds for the year in one day!
We picked the day a few weeks ago and we were lucky to enjoy perfect conditions weather-wise. All caches were quick finds except for 1 DNF. We took turns driving and finding, and signed the logs as P U P-P. We started at the eastern end to fill a few spots on our D/T grids and zig-zagged our way back towards the NW corner.
We really enjoyed driving through this beautiful forest. We disturbed several kangaroos and a rabbit along the way, and only came across one other car. There were quite a few trees laying across the roads but most of them already had a by-pass track. We had to make our own way through the bush for a couple but it was nothing that Photo-Play’s 4WD could not handle.

The log was signed as “PUPP” (papillon367, ullyssia and Photo-Play) We joined up and formed the gang again to tackle the rest of this series. It is a great drive through this area.

Photo-Play, ullyssia and I teamed up to complete the 4WD series that we had started in December. We picked up the one that was missing last time and also got to a few traditionals along the way. All caches were quick finds and we signed the logs as P U P-P. It was a nice drive through this beautiful forest and great to have the full geo-art showing on our maps now! The timing was perfect as we collected many of the new Wonders as well. We also took the opportunity to pick up some rubbish for the Locationless cache  .</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Thank you!  The PUPP team (papillon367, ullyssia and Photo-Play) headed out on a rather nice summer's day to tackle the FOTT.  I enjoyed travelling along the tracks, admiring the views at the top of the various hills, seeing the vegetation change at the bottom, and checking out some nice granite outcrops.
I thought we might get half of the series done, but was super happy when we managed to find 151 of the FOTTs, and a nearby traditional.  All caches were in good condition, and most were found without too much trouble, though we did have one DNF which I hope to rectify at some point, perhaps when we head back to complete the series.</groundspeak:text>

Signed the log as “PUPP” (papillon367, ullyssia and Photo-Play) We joined up and formed a gang to tackle this series. Planning was a few weeks prior so we put our order in for perfect weather. It was a great drive through this area and nice to get up close to a few of the locals. Most caches were quick finds except one. The track was acceptable with a few obstacles and detours. Although we are not complete, this is a fantastic series with about 150 completed today. We’ll be back to finish off. Thanks for bringing us to this area.

Photo-Play, ullyssia and I teamed up to start this series and we had a successful day with 152 finds over 8hrs of caching (plus 3hrs driving there and back), our best daily achievement. This is also over a quarter of my finds for the year in one day!
We picked the day a few weeks ago and we were lucky to enjoy perfect conditions weather-wise. All caches were quick finds except for 1 DNF. We took turns driving and finding, and signed the logs as P U P-P. We started at the eastern end to fill a few spots on our D/T grids and zig-zagged our way back towards the NW corner.
We really enjoyed driving through this beautiful forest. We disturbed several kangaroos and a rabbit along the way, and only came across one other car. There were quite a few trees laying across the roads but most of them already had a by-pass track. We had to make our own way through the bush for a couple but it was nothing that Photo-Play’s 4WD could not handle.

After doing half of them by the time we had lunch we decided to continue and see if we could do them all today so it ended up being a full day of caching doing them all.

All caches found without too much searching although whoever pushed some of the containers right into the ground and/or mulch didn't realise that they would be covered over by insect activity making them all but impossible to find without reference to the hints.

Logs signed and caches returned as found (except for the buried ones which were left out of the ground/mulch.

Thanks Fellowship Of The Trail for placing these caches for us to find.</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Thank you!  The PUPP team (papillon367, ullyssia and Photo-Play) headed out on a rather nice summer's day to tackle the FOTT.  I enjoyed travelling along the tracks, admiring the views at the top of the various hills, seeing the vegetation change at the bottom, and checking out some nice granite outcrops.
I thought we might get half of the series done, but was super happy when we managed to find 151 of the FOTTs, and a nearby traditional.  All caches were in good condition, and most were found without too much trouble, though we did have one DNF which I hope to rectify at some point, perhaps when we head back to complete the series.</groundspeak:text>

Signed the log as “PUPP” (papillon367, ullyssia and Photo-Play) We joined up and formed a gang to tackle this series. Planning was a few weeks prior so we put our order in for perfect weather. It was a great drive through this area and nice to get up close to a few of the locals. Most caches were quick finds except one. The track was acceptable with a few obstacles and detours. Although we are not complete, this is a fantastic series with about 150 completed today. We’ll be back to finish off. Thanks for bringing us to this area.

Photo-Play, ullyssia and I teamed up to start this series and we had a successful day with 152 finds over 8hrs of caching (plus 3hrs driving there and back), our best daily achievement. This is also over a quarter of my finds for the year in one day!
We picked the day a few weeks ago and we were lucky to enjoy perfect conditions weather-wise. All caches were quick finds except for 1 DNF. We took turns driving and finding, and signed the logs as P U P-P. We started at the eastern end to fill a few spots on our D/T grids and zig-zagged our way back towards the NW corner.
We really enjoyed driving through this beautiful forest. We disturbed several kangaroos and a rabbit along the way, and only came across one other car. There were quite a few trees laying across the roads but most of them already had a by-pass track. We had to make our own way through the bush for a couple but it was nothing that Photo-Play’s 4WD could not handle. 
Will be back to finish off the series!</groundspeak:text>

After doing half of them by the time we had lunch we decided to continue and see if we could do them all today so it ended up being a full day of caching doing them all.

All caches found without too much searching although whoever pushed some of the containers right into the ground and/or mulch didn't realise that they would be covered over by insect activity making them all but impossible to find without reference to the hints.

Logs signed and caches returned as found (except for the buried ones which were left out of the ground/mulch.

This was my nemesis cache today. When I got to GZ, I couldn’t find the cache even with the hint. I immediately realised I must have transposed the coords. I got further down the road and did the jigidi on the phone. All good, I did have the wrong coords by about 30m. Returning to GZ, I made a quick-ish find.</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Thank you!  The PUPP team (papillon367, ullyssia and Photo-Play) headed out on a rather nice summer's day to tackle the FOTT.  I enjoyed travelling along the tracks, admiring the views at the top of the various hills, seeing the vegetation change at the bottom, and checking out some nice granite outcrops.
I thought we might get half of the series done, but was super happy when we managed to find 151 of the FOTTs, and a nearby traditional.  All caches were in good condition, and most were found without too much trouble, though we did have one DNF which I hope to rectify at some point, perhaps when we head back to complete the series.</groundspeak:text>

Signed the log as “PUPP” (papillon367, ullyssia and Photo-Play) We joined up and formed a gang to tackle this series. Planning was a few weeks prior so we put our order in for perfect weather. It was a great drive through this area and nice to get up close to a few of the locals. Most caches were quick finds except one. The track was acceptable with a few obstacles and detours. Although we are not complete, this is a fantastic series with about 150 completed today. We’ll be back to finish off. Thanks for bringing us to this area. There’s going to be a lot of generic logs here, sorry.</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">A quick find here. Thank you for the cache and for the fun series Fellowship Of The Trail! Apologies for the generic logs…
Photo-Play, ullyssia and I teamed up to start this series and we had a successful day with 152 finds over 8hrs of caching (plus 3hrs driving there and back), our best daily achievement. This is also over a quarter of my finds for the year in one day!
We picked the day a few weeks ago and we were lucky to enjoy perfect conditions weather-wise. All caches were quick finds except for 1 DNF. We took turns driving and finding, and signed the logs as P U P-P. We started at the eastern end to fill a few spots on our D/T grids and zig-zagged our way back towards the NW corner.
We really enjoyed driving through this beautiful forest. We disturbed several kangaroos and a rabbit along the way, and only came across one other car. There were quite a few trees laying across the roads but most of them already had a by-pass track. We had to make our own way through the bush for a couple but it was nothing that Photo-Play’s 4WD could not handle. 
Will be back to finish off the series!</groundspeak:text>

After doing half of them by the time we had lunch we decided to continue and see if we could do them all today so it ended up being a full day of caching doing them all.

All caches found without too much searching although whoever pushed some of the containers right into the ground and/or mulch didn't realise that they would be covered over by insect activity making them all but impossible to find without reference to the hints.

Logs signed and caches returned as found (except for the buried ones which were left out of the ground/mulch.

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Thank you!  The PUPP team (papillon367, ullyssia and Photo-Play) headed out on a rather nice summer's day to tackle the FOTT.  I enjoyed travelling along the tracks, admiring the views at the top of the various hills, seeing the vegetation change at the bottom, and checking out some nice granite outcrops.
I thought we might get half of the series done, but was super happy when we managed to find 151 of the FOTTs, and a nearby traditional.  All caches were in good condition, and most were found without too much trouble, though we did have one DNF which I hope to rectify at some point, perhaps when we head back to complete the series.</groundspeak:text>

It was a great drive through this area and nice to get up close to a few of the locals. Most caches were quick finds except one. The track was acceptable with a few obstacles and detours. Although we are not complete, this is a fantastic series with about 150 completed today. We’ll be back to finish off. Thanks for bringing us to this area.

Photo-Play, ullyssia and I teamed up to start this series and we had a successful day with 152 finds over 8hrs of caching (plus 3hrs driving there and back), our best daily achievement. This is also over a quarter of my finds for the year in one day!
We picked the day a few weeks ago and we were lucky to enjoy perfect conditions weather-wise. All caches were quick finds except for 1 DNF. We took turns driving and finding, and signed the logs as P U P-P. We started at the eastern end to fill a few spots on our D/T grids and zig-zagged our way back towards the NW corner.
We really enjoyed driving through this beautiful forest. We disturbed several kangaroos and a rabbit along the way, and only came across one other car. There were quite a few trees laying across the roads but most of them already had a by-pass track. We had to make our own way through the bush for a couple but it was nothing that Photo-Play’s 4WD could not handle.

After doing half of them by the time we had lunch we decided to continue and see if we could do them all today so it ended up being a full day of caching doing them all.

All caches found without too much searching although whoever pushed some of the containers right into the ground and/or mulch didn't realise that they would be covered over by insect activity making them all but impossible to find without reference to the hints.

Logs signed and caches returned as found (except for the buried ones which were left out of the ground/mulch.

I enjoyed travelling along the tracks, admiring the views at the top of the various hills, seeing the vegetation change at the bottom, and checking out some nice granite outcrops.
I thought we might get half of the series done, but was super happy when we managed to find 151 of the FOTTs, and a nearby traditional.  All caches were in good condition, and most were found without too much trouble, though we did have one DNF which I hope to rectify at some point, perhaps when we head back to complete the series.</groundspeak:text>

Signed the log as “PUPP” (papillon367, ullyssia and Photo-Play) We joined up and formed a gang to tackle this series. Planning was a few weeks prior so we put our order in for perfect weather. It was a great drive through this area and nice to get up close to a few of the locals. Most caches were quick finds except one. The track was acceptable with a few obstacles and detours. Although we are not complete, this is a fantastic series with about 150 completed today. We’ll be back to finish off. Thanks for bringing us to this area.

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">A quick find here. Thank you for the cache and for the fun series Fellowship Of The Trail! Apologies for the generic logs…
Photo-Play, ullyssia and I teamed up to start this series and we had a successful day with 152 finds over 8hrs of caching (plus 3hrs driving there and back), our best daily achievement. This is also over a quarter of my finds for the year in one day!
We picked the day a few weeks ago and we were lucky to enjoy perfect conditions weather-wise. All caches were quick finds except for 1 DNF. We took turns driving and finding, and signed the logs as P U P-P. We started at the eastern end to fill a few spots on our D/T grids and zig-zagged our way back towards the NW corner.
We really enjoyed driving through this beautiful forest. We disturbed several kangaroos and a rabbit along the way, and only came across one other car. There were quite a few trees laying across the roads but most of them already had a by-pass track. We had to make our own way through the bush for a couple but it was nothing that Photo-Play’s 4WD could not handle. 
Will be back to finish off the series!</groundspeak:text>

After doing half of them by the time we had lunch we decided to continue and see if we could do them all today so it ended up being a full day of caching doing them all.

All caches found without too much searching although whoever pushed some of the containers right into the ground and/or mulch didn't realise that they would be covered over by insect activity making them all but impossible to find without reference to the hints.

Logs signed and caches returned as found (except for the buried ones which were left out of the ground/mulch.

Although we are not complete, this is a fantastic series with about 150 completed today. We’ll be back to finish off. Thanks for bringing us to this area. There’s going to be a lot of generic logs here, sorry.</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">A quick find here. Thank you for the cache and for the fun series Fellowship Of The Trail! Apologies for the generic logs…
Photo-Play, ullyssia and I teamed up to start this series and we had a successful day with 152 finds over 8hrs of caching (plus 3hrs driving there and back), our best daily achievement. This is also over a quarter of my finds for the year in one day!
We picked the day a few weeks ago and we were lucky to enjoy perfect conditions weather-wise. All caches were quick finds except for 1 DNF. We took turns driving and finding, and signed the logs as P U P-P. We started at the eastern end to fill a few spots on our D/T grids and zig-zagged our way back towards the NW corner.
We really enjoyed driving through this beautiful forest. We disturbed several kangaroos and a rabbit along the way, and only came across one other car. There were quite a few trees laying across the roads but most of them already had a by-pass track. We had to make our own way through the bush for a couple but it was nothing that Photo-Play’s 4WD could not handle. 
Will be back to finish off the series!</groundspeak:text>

After doing half of them by the time we had lunch we decided to continue and see if we could do them all today so it ended up being a full day of caching doing them all.

All caches found without too much searching although whoever pushed some of the containers right into the ground and/or mulch didn't realise that they would be covered over by insect activity making them all but impossible to find without reference to the hints.

Logs signed and caches returned as found (except for the buried ones which were left out of the ground/mulch.

Thanks Fellowship Of The Trail for placing these caches for us to find.</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Thank you!  The PUPP team (papillon367, ullyssia and Photo-Play) headed out on a rather nice summer's day to tackle the FOTT.  I enjoyed travelling along the tracks, admiring the views at the top of the various hills, seeing the vegetation change at the bottom, and checking out some nice granite outcrops.
I thought we might get half of the series done, but was super happy when we managed to find 151 of the FOTTs, and a nearby traditional.  All caches were in good condition, and most were found without too much trouble, though we did have one DNF which I hope to rectify at some point, perhaps when we head back to complete the series.</groundspeak:text>

I enjoyed travelling along the tracks, admiring the views at the top of the various hills, seeing the vegetation change at the bottom, and checking out some nice granite outcrops.
I thought we might get half of the series done, but was super happy when we managed to find 151 of the FOTTs, and a nearby traditional.

Photo-Play, ullyssia and I teamed up to start this series and we had a successful day with 152 finds over 8hrs of caching (plus 3hrs driving there and back), our best daily achievement. This is also over a quarter of my finds for the year in one day!
We picked the day a few weeks ago and we were lucky to enjoy perfect conditions weather-wise. All caches were quick finds except for 1 DNF. We took turns driving and finding, and signed the logs as P U P-P. We started at the eastern end to fill a few spots on our D/T grids and zig-zagged our way back towards the NW corner.
We really enjoyed driving through this beautiful forest. We disturbed several kangaroos and a rabbit along the way, and only came across one other car. There were quite a few trees laying across the roads but most of them already had a by-pass track. We had to make our own way through the bush for a couple but it was nothing that Photo-Play’s 4WD could not handle.

Thanks Fellowship Of The Trail for placing these caches for us to find.</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Thank you!  The PUPP team (papillon367, ullyssia and Photo-Play) headed out on a rather nice summer's day to tackle the FOTT.  I enjoyed travelling along the tracks, admiring the views at the top of the various hills, seeing the vegetation change at the bottom, and checking out some nice granite outcrops.
I thought we might get half of the series done, but was super happy when we managed to find 151 of the FOTTs, and a nearby traditional.  All caches were in good condition, and most were found without too much trouble, though we did have one DNF which I hope to rectify at some point, perhaps when we head back to complete the series.</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Thank you!  The PUPP team (papillon367, ullyssia and Photo-Play) headed out on a rather nice summer's day to tackle the FOTT.  I enjoyed travelling along the tracks, admiring the views at the top of the various hills, seeing the vegetation change at the bottom, and checking out some nice granite outcrops.
I thought we might get half of the series done, but was super happy when we managed to find 151 of the FOTTs, and a nearby traditional.  All caches were in good condition, and most were found without too much trouble, though we did have one DNF which I hope to rectify at some point, perhaps when we head back to complete the series.</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Found it. TFTC The Fellowship of The Trial. Signed the log as “PUPP” (papillon367, ullyssia and Photo-Play) We joined up and formed a gang to tackle this series. Planning was a few weeks prior so we put our order in for perfect weather. It was a great drive through this area and nice to get up close to a few of the locals. Most caches were quick finds except one. The track was acceptable with a few obstacles and detours. Although we are not complete, this is a fantastic series with about 150 completed today. We’ll be back to finish off. Thanks for bringing us to this area. There’s going to be a lot of generic logs here, sorry.</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">A quick find here. Thank you for the cache and for the fun series Fellowship Of The Trail! Apologies for the generic logs…
Photo-Play, ullyssia and I teamed up to start this series and we had a successful day with 152 finds over 8hrs of caching (plus 3hrs driving there and back), our best daily achievement. This is also over a quarter of my finds for the year in one day!
We picked the day a few weeks ago and we were lucky to enjoy perfect conditions weather-wise. All caches were quick finds except for 1 DNF. We took turns driving and finding, and signed the logs as P U P-P. We started at the eastern end to fill a few spots on our D/T grids and zig-zagged our way back towards the NW corner.
We really enjoyed driving through this beautiful forest. We disturbed several kangaroos and a rabbit along the way, and only came across one other car. There were quite a few trees laying across the roads but most of them already had a by-pass track. We had to make our own way through the bush for a couple but it was nothing that Photo-Play’s 4WD could not handle. 
Will be back to finish off the series!</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Thank you!  The PUPP team (papillon367, ullyssia and Photo-Play) headed out on a rather nice summer's day to tackle the FOTT.  I enjoyed travelling along the tracks, admiring the views at the top of the various hills, seeing the vegetation change at the bottom, and checking out some nice granite outcrops.
I thought we might get half of the series done, but was super happy when we managed to find 151 of the FOTTs, and a nearby traditional.  All caches were in good condition, and most were found without too much trouble, though we did have one DNF which I hope to rectify at some point, perhaps when we head back to complete the series.</groundspeak:text>

Signed the log as “PUPP” (papillon367, ullyssia and Photo-Play) We joined up and formed a gang to tackle this series. Planning was a few weeks prior so we put our order in for perfect weather. It was a great drive through this area and nice to get up close to a few of the locals. Most caches were quick finds except one. The track was acceptable with a few obstacles and detours. Although we are not complete, this is a fantastic series with about 150 completed today. We’ll be back to finish off. Thanks for bringing us to this area.

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">A quick find here. Thank you for the cache and for the fun series Fellowship Of The Trail! Apologies for the generic logs…
Photo-Play, ullyssia and I teamed up to start this series and we had a successful day with 152 finds over 8hrs of caching (plus 3hrs driving there and back), our best daily achievement. This is also over a quarter of my finds for the year in one day!
We picked the day a few weeks ago and we were lucky to enjoy perfect conditions weather-wise. All caches were quick finds except for 1 DNF. We took turns driving and finding, and signed the logs as P U P-P. We started at the eastern end to fill a few spots on our D/T grids and zig-zagged our way back towards the NW corner.
We really enjoyed driving through this beautiful forest. We disturbed several kangaroos and a rabbit along the way, and only came across one other car. There were quite a few trees laying across the roads but most of them already had a by-pass track. We had to make our own way through the bush for a couple but it was nothing that Photo-Play’s 4WD could not handle. 
Will be back to finish off the series!</groundspeak:text>

Thanks Fellowship of the Trail for an excellent series. Caching in the bush with just the sounds of the birds is magic.

Beekeeper Rd was navigatible with my Mazdarati with clearance in summer but the track is tight and full of dry parrot bush.... I am loving the sound of the paint on my car being scratched!</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Thank you!  The PUPP team (papillon367, ullyssia and Photo-Play) headed out on a rather nice summer's day to tackle the FOTT.  I enjoyed travelling along the tracks, admiring the views at the top of the various hills, seeing the vegetation change at the bottom, and checking out some nice granite outcrops.
I thought we might get half of the series done, but was super happy when we managed to find 151 of the FOTTs, and a nearby traditional.  All caches were in good condition, and most were found without too much trouble, though we did have one DNF which I hope to rectify at some point, perhaps when we head back to complete the series.</groundspeak:text>

Signed the log as “PUPP” (papillon367, ullyssia and Photo-Play) We joined up and formed a gang to tackle this series. Planning was a few weeks prior so we put our order in for perfect weather. It was a great drive through this area and nice to get up close to a few of the locals. Most caches were quick finds except one. The track was acceptable with a few obstacles and detours. Although we are not complete, this is a fantastic series with about 150 completed today. We’ll be back to finish off. Thanks for bringing us to this area. There’s going to be a lot of generic logs here, sorry.</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">A quick find here. Thank you for the cache and for the fun series Fellowship Of The Trail! Apologies for the generic logs…
Photo-Play, ullyssia and I teamed up to start this series and we had a successful day with 152 finds over 8hrs of caching (plus 3hrs driving there and back), our best daily achievement. This is also over a quarter of my finds for the year in one day!
We picked the day a few weeks ago and we were lucky to enjoy perfect conditions weather-wise. All caches were quick finds except for 1 DNF. We took turns driving and finding, and signed the logs as P U P-P. We started at the eastern end to fill a few spots on our D/T grids and zig-zagged our way back towards the NW corner.
We really enjoyed driving through this beautiful forest. We disturbed several kangaroos and a rabbit along the way, and only came across one other car. There were quite a few trees laying across the roads but most of them already had a by-pass track. We had to make our own way through the bush for a couple but it was nothing that Photo-Play’s 4WD could not handle. 
Will be back to finish off the series!</groundspeak:text>

Teamed up with our family to conquer this series. With all the puzzles solved we had a great weekend in the forest locating the caches. Log signed as W.L.M. (WayneO, Leonie1971, Molibako).

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Thank you!  The PUPP team (papillon367, ullyssia and Photo-Play) headed out on a rather nice summer's day to tackle the FOTT.  I enjoyed travelling along the tracks, admiring the views at the top of the various hills, seeing the vegetation change at the bottom, and checking out some nice granite outcrops.
I thought we might get half of the series done, but was super happy when we managed to find 151 of the FOTTs, and a nearby traditional.  All caches were in good condition, and most were found without too much trouble, though we did have one DNF which I hope to rectify at some point, perhaps when we head back to complete the series.</groundspeak:text>

Signed the log as “PUPP” (papillon367, ullyssia and Photo-Play) We joined up and formed a gang to tackle this series. Planning was a few weeks prior so we put our order in for perfect weather. It was a great drive through this area and nice to get up close to a few of the locals. Most caches were quick finds except one. The track was acceptable with a few obstacles and detours. Although we are not complete, this is a fantastic series with about 150 completed today. We’ll be back to finish off. Thanks for bringing us to this area. There’s going to be a lot of generic logs here, sorry.</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">A quick find here. Thank you for the cache and for the fun series Fellowship Of The Trail! Apologies for the generic logs…
Photo-Play, ullyssia and I teamed up to start this series and we had a successful day with 152 finds over 8hrs of caching (plus 3hrs driving there and back), our best daily achievement. This is also over a quarter of my finds for the year in one day!
We picked the day a few weeks ago and we were lucky to enjoy perfect conditions weather-wise. All caches were quick finds except for 1 DNF. We took turns driving and finding, and signed the logs as P U P-P. We started at the eastern end to fill a few spots on our D/T grids and zig-zagged our way back towards the NW corner.
We really enjoyed driving through this beautiful forest. We disturbed several kangaroos and a rabbit along the way, and only came across one other car. There were quite a few trees laying across the roads but most of them already had a by-pass track. We had to make our own way through the bush for a couple but it was nothing that Photo-Play’s 4WD could not handle. 
Will be back to finish off the series!</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Thank you!  The PUPP team (papillon367, ullyssia and Photo-Play) headed out on a rather nice summer's day to tackle the FOTT.  I enjoyed travelling along the tracks, admiring the views at the top of the various hills, seeing the vegetation change at the bottom, and checking out some nice granite outcrops.
I thought we might get half of the series done, but was super happy when we managed to find 151 of the FOTTs, and a nearby traditional.  All caches were in good condition, and most were found without too much trouble, though we did have one DNF which I hope to rectify at some point, perhaps when we head back to complete the series.</groundspeak:text>

Signed the log as “PUPP” (papillon367, ullyssia and Photo-Play) We joined up and formed a gang to tackle this series. Planning was a few weeks prior so we put our order in for perfect weather. It was a great drive through this area and nice to get up close to a few of the locals. Most caches were quick finds except one. The track was acceptable with a few obstacles and detours. Although we are not complete, this is a fantastic series with about 150 completed today. We’ll be back to finish off. Thanks for bringing us to this area.

Photo-Play, ullyssia and I teamed up to start this series and we had a successful day with 152 finds over 8hrs of caching (plus 3hrs driving there and back), our best daily achievement. This is also over a quarter of my finds for the year in one day!
We picked the day a few weeks ago and we were lucky to enjoy perfect conditions weather-wise. All caches were quick finds except for 1 DNF. We took turns driving and finding, and signed the logs as P U P-P. We started at the eastern end to fill a few spots on our D/T grids and zig-zagged our way back towards the NW corner.
We really enjoyed driving through this beautiful forest. We disturbed several kangaroos and a rabbit along the way, and only came across one other car. There were quite a few trees laying across the roads but most of them already had a by-pass track. We had to make our own way through the bush for a couple but it was nothing that Photo-Play’s 4WD could not handle.

All caches found without too much searching although whoever pushed some of the containers right into the ground and/or mulch didn't realise that they would be covered over by insect activity making them all but impossible to find without reference to the hints.

Logs signed and caches returned as found (except for the buried ones which were left out of the ground/mulch.

All caches found without too much searching although whoever pushed some of the containers right into the ground and/or mulch didn't realise that they would be covered over by insect activity making them all but impossible to find without reference to the hints.

Logs signed and caches returned as found (except for the buried ones which were left out of the ground/mulch.

Thanks Fellowship Of The Trail for placing these caches for us to find.</groundspeak:text>

When I reached GZ I thought it may have been burnt out as GZ was right next to a burnt out tree. after a few minutes searching I widened the search and found it about 10m away

This was find number 3 for the day.

Thanks Fellowship of the Trail for an excellent series. Caching in the bush with just the sounds of the birds is magic.

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Thank you!  The PUPP team (papillon367, ullyssia and Photo-Play) headed out on a rather nice summer's day to tackle the FOTT.  I enjoyed travelling along the tracks, admiring the views at the top of the various hills, seeing the vegetation change at the bottom, and checking out some nice granite outcrops.
I thought we might get half of the series done, but was super happy when we managed to find 151 of the FOTTs, and a nearby traditional.  All caches were in good condition, and most were found without too much trouble, though we did have one DNF which I hope to rectify at some point, perhaps when we head back to complete the series. 
A fav for me as this fills in a hole in my DT grid.</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Found it. TFTC The Fellowship of The Trial. Signed the log as “PUPP” (papillon367, ullyssia and Photo-Play) We joined up and formed a gang to tackle this series. Planning was a few weeks prior so we put our order in for perfect weather. It was a great drive through this area and nice to get up close to a few of the locals. Most caches were quick finds except one. The track was acceptable with a few obstacles and detours. Although we are not complete, this is a fantastic series with about 150 completed today. We’ll be back to finish off. Thanks for bringing us to this area. There’s going to be a lot of generic logs here, sorry.</groundspeak:text>
