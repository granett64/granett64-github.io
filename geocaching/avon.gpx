&lt;h1 style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;jasenjanine 5000 find tribute cache&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This cache is dedicated to team jasenjanine and their recent 5000 finds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whilst they started the geocaching adventures in Queensland, they now reside in the sunny West and have continued their search of the unloved, archived, and remote caches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When deciding on a suitable tribute, I racked my brain for a suitable placement. There are gold ammo cans for 1000 finds, but what to do for 5000 ???&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;What makes this team...who they are today ?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="jasenjanine" src="http://i1278.photobucket.com/albums/y519/Breht_Townsing/Mobile%20Uploads/image_zps0f3b34f2.jpg" style="height:481px; width:684px" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;jasenjanine are known to chase out the caches many others forget, the caches that haven't been found for years, the archived ones, the ones located in places that actually take some planning and work to get to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So when placing this cache, it needed some attributes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;- 4WD access &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;- Remote enough to need some planning&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;- A great location (views etc)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;- Be able to take the kids (did I mention dangermouse09 and his younger brother?)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;- How can we factor in an archived cache ??&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found the site of an archived cache that used to be just near this location and found this place fits the bill. I'm guessing a lot of people wont come out to this cache, but that wont bother jasenjanine. They like the challenge of the find.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Congrats jasenjanine. I hope you like this cache but more importantly, the location. I think it suits you down to the ground&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <groundspeak:short_description html="False">The cache is located near a bbq area in a Park (will need a 4WD). Turn off Julimar Rd onto Plunket Rd (S31 29.876 E116 14.049). Follow Plunket Road (at Beach Rd intersection it turns into a track, follow the track). You will see a sign for the Park. Enter the Park and follow your GPS.  It is a steep and rough descent. The bbq area will require the use of 4WD on the way back up.</groundspeak:short_description>
   <groundspeak:long_description html="False"> The cache is a red lunchbox with a small number of items including Tigger who has come North from Mandurah way.After rain this road may be closed by a gate. You will need to decide if your vehicle and skills meet the requirements to commence the descent.

Boy, were we happy to claim a smiley here today, we had previously attempted to get to GZ but horrendous washouts didn’t allow it to be leaving a green dot on our map. Today we chose our route and after a slow but steady assault on the track we had made our way to GZ, a few minutes searching then the celebratory “I’ve got it” echoed through the valley, we performed our signing duties and replaced the cache safely as found, what a bloody good day TFTC</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Thank God it was there and easy to find. One of the two main reasons I headed out this way this morning, I wanted this one for my grid. After bypassing the locked gate coming in from the north, I stopped about 800m from GZ when the track started to get a bit too dicey. Good thing I did as the track became unpassable around the corner due to recent rain and resulting track wash out (probably the reason for the locked gate).

Hiked the rest of the way down on my dodgy knee and thankfully didn't have any issues with the find. Cache is in good condition. All that was left was the hike back up the hill to the parked car!

   <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:undefined;"&gt;Bald Hill Campground is one of several campgrounds located in the stunning Avon Valley National Park. It has campsites, picnic tables, fire rings, toilets and untreated water. It is also suitable for small caravans or camper trailers only. Campfires are usually permitted between 1 April and 30 November but fire restrictions may be imposed at any time and without notice. Bring your own firewood.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span style="font-size:undefined;"&gt;The Avon Valley National Park features forests and granite outcrops with panoramic views over the valley. It is a great place to see a wide variety of wildflowers and birds during spring. There are limited facilities and development within the park, making it ideal for campers looking for a more wilderness experience. This campground has panoramic views over the whole Avon Alley.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span style="font-size:undefined;"&gt;Cache is a 200ml sistema hidden behind a large rock.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">After starting this series late last year, this cache has been on our radar ever since... Whilst in the area today, we made sure to also pay this one a visit [:)]  On previous visits to the area, we had figured out our route to the cache &amp; after having our picnic lunch with the kids we set off on foot in the direction of this cache... The walk was easy going &amp; the kids eagerly ran on ahead hoping to find the cache first!  Turns out that something distracted them once close &amp; it was Jase who easily spotted the ammo tin as it had nowhere to hide [;)]

We opened the burnt tin to find the old charcoaled log &amp; still managed to read alot of the log entries.  The kids removed alot of the burnt marbles &amp; managed to get them shining again!  We placed in a  new logbook and left  the old logbook for the select few that may also enjoy finding this one too [^]

&lt;p&gt;This cache should be difficult to track down as it contains many secrets and treasures
from another demension ....&lt;br&gt;
well some cache collector cards anyway :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We rated this one a 3 star but will consider from the logs a 2 or 4 depending on
hunters success rates. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cache contents include : some Cache collector cards, Log Book, Pencil and Sharpener. &lt;br&gt;
No swaps in this one as it's a fairly small container .... well inside anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A successful hunt will have you discovering &lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="2" face="Verdana"
color="#FF0000"&gt;The Secrets of the 'Bermuda Triangle'&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color="blue" size="2"

It's not your usual cache, hence the Mystery tag and we hope it will provide many hours of
frustration.&lt;br&gt;
You will require some natural cache hunting skills

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Headed out today for a special caching adventure in the Avon Valley today &amp; this "Bonus Cache" we found on our trip to the area [:)]  I had stumbled across this cache listing whilst investigating Bermuda Triangle I &amp; II and thought the location seemed very familiar?  After putting my detective skills to work, I found that the location of this cache would be not too far from our destination today [;)]

We did set out to find BT I &amp; II first, but having limited time we did not quite get there... We did however stumble across this cache after a more than decent search!!!  Jase first spotted the logbook which was in its bag along with a pencil, sharpener &amp; a couple of small swaps nicely placed under some rocks [?] ... Once that was found, he quickly eyed the camoed object where the box once hid [:D]

Wow, that was an exciting moment to be stumbling across this cache, well and truly out in the middle of nowhere... All the excitement quickly drew to an end though, as we realised that we were well &amp; truly running out of time to make it back home for school pickup time [:O]

TFTC TEAM LANDCRUISER [8D]  Quickly heading back towards the car, we decided that we should put the logbook back in another container &amp; place it back in it's camo just in case some other crazy cachers want to seek this one out too [^]  It was a bit of a tight fit for the container, but it is now back as it was intended... We will be back soon to complete the triangle!</groundspeak:text>

Wanted something a bit special for the milestone and this one ticked quite a few boxes: top 3 oldest hidden date in the state, a challenge to get to and an awesome location. I'd scouted out a few tracks in the area on previous visits, however this was my first time in the National Park proper. I came in via the main entrance on Quarry Road then had a drive to the various campsites for a bit of sightseeing and to check them out for a future visit :) Occasionally I tried a few tracks heading in the general direction of GZ but all eventually ended in dead-ends. The closest I got was 6.5km away! Coming back south east from Bald Hill however I spotted another untried track as I drove past. I hadn't seen it all coming the other way. After reversing back a little I headed down the track and found myself in a network of very overgrown tracks... but heading in the right direction. After a few more false leads, and a LOT of pinstripes on the car from the narrow tracks, I found myself on a pretty decent track. Then I came up to a fallen tree blocking the way. Unfortunately I got bogged trying to go around it and the recovery tracks could only get me back to where I started. Nothing for it but to clear the tree away - not too hard but pretty time-consuming. Once clear I was off again zig-zagging tracks until I found myself at the start of the track to the west of GZ... but still 2km away. The track fell away steeply and was not in great condition. Not knowing the condition further along I didn't want to commit so locked up the 4WD and headed off on foot. It was a tough hike no two ways about it. But eventually I got to GZ and was stoked to make a pretty quick find. No finders since June 2016 but everything is in great condition. Fantastic :) It had taken so long to get here via 4WD and foot that it was almost dark by the time I got back to the car. Only on the walk back did it cross my mind I may well be locked it for the night...! A long slow nighttime drive back along the tracks eventually got me back on to Quarry Road about 8pm. And the gates were still open! Hurrah!

Quite the adventure, just what I wanted :) TFTC and a favourite for sure.</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Camped overnight at Bald Hill so took the opportunity for an early morning drive out to this old cache :) Tracks were mostly easy going with the short stick only being needed on a couple of steeper sections. Lovely drive, and some new pinstripes to show for it! Parked up in the small clearing near GZ and then got out to check my bearings. Hmm... can’t see any large rocks... and can’t see any tracks going that way either. Grabbed a hiking pole anyway and headed off towards GZ. Light bush so was pretty easy going and with about 5m to go I finally spied rocks :) Coords were spot on; as soon as I got to GZ I spotted the container tucked away. I thought my eyes were deceiving me though when I saw the last entry was dated over 3 years ago! But no, it has been that long since a find here. No idea why, it’s a fantastic location. It was also great to see it was an old-school log book where people had actually written comments on the find / adventure. Spent a few minutes sitting reading all those then added my own and put everything back as found. After all this time everything here is still in perfect condition. Very peaceful spot, it was just me and a million flies :) Probably should have saved this one for a milestone but heck I was nearby and it was awesome anyway :) A definite fave point awarded - TFTC</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Well, I must say that this cache has been on our radar since before we even moved up into the hills a couple of years ago [:O]. It took a newly published series nearby though to get us of our bums and head back into Moondyne Joe country!

After finishing the Moondyne Rocks series, we set about finding an access road that would get us close to this one. Janine was on navigator duties, and with some clever map work (and a little luck), we eventually found ourselves within around 50m from GZ [:D]

We all headed down from where we parked, but it was Master 6 who motored ahead of all of us to make the find where we told him it should be [;)]
We added our names to the log book before rehiding the cache and heading back up to the car.

It’s such a good feeling to find really old caches like this .. even more so when you know that its’ only been found 17 times in as many years. This is what we love the most about this game for sure .. rarely found, out of the way and a real adventure to get to [^] ... have a Fave Point

We looked at a number of ways in and headed down to the farm to find the locked gates. We back tracked a little a find an open gate down which the local farmer was just about to shut and said it went down to the power line track but he said after 100m it closed in and would make a mess of the car so it was back to the farm gate and off on foot. The track was not too steep or rough until the  last few hundred meters. It was then off the track into the creek to find that rock and we soon found the hide. Great to see an old cache still going. We completed the signing duties and re hid.  Now seeing Avon Trails was only 600m away and there was a track down to the river we set off. TFTC.</groundspeak:text>

We started our travels in Perth and went in the following 20 days south to Bunbury, Busselton, Margaret River, Pemberton, Denmark, Albany, Hopetoun and Esperance. We continued north to Kalgoorlie, further to the West to Hyden, Northam, Muchea and Cervantes. From Cervantes we drove back to Perth with a final stop at Rottnest Island.
Besides the sightseeing spots we visited and looked for different cache types as
Traditionals, Multis, WherIGos, Letterboxes, Mysteries, Earthcaches and Virtuals. It’s all in the mix.
We could lern a lot about the hide and seek in Western Australia. Maybe we can use the gained knowledge in Germany to hide some caches the way you do in Australia.
We enjoyed these amazing 3 weeks in Down Under as we could do in 2010 and we hope to come to Australia again as soon as possible.

Sorry, the logs are not unique for each cache but we had fun looking for every single one.

      <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Out today to pick up a trio of caches in the area, just to nudge me towards the 3000 finds milestone. Selected for the great locations, chance for a bit of easy 4WD, and in the case of this one, its advanced age. On that note, it was also an opportunity to scout out the tracks around here for my milestone find ;) Felt like I had the place to myself here today which was great! Nice drive along to the suggested parking spot, from where I hopped out and admired the view :) Then it was down to business and I was heading off to GZ. Once there I found myself going in circles a little but patience paid off and after a few minutes I'd spotted the container :) I already have this spot filled on my Jasmer grid however it's still awesome to find a hide from 2002 (even though I suspect it's not the original container, lol).

With Janine having all the fun at another FTF in this area earlier in the week, this latest publication gave me the chance to explore the area again myself.
Having narrowed down a few possible entry points, the first couple I tried had promise but they quickly narrowed to scratchy parrot bush tracks (no, I'm not ready to sacrifice my paintwork for a cache just yet [:P])
I continued scouting my options and I eventually found a sneaky one that had me on track to where I needed to be [:O]. After about 7 kms, the track narrowed to where I decided to stop and hoof it with 1 km to GZ .. after all, having spent the last 3 weeks sitting in a digger, I thought it wouldn't do me once iota of harm  [:o)] 
The walk was good ... until the numbers started counting up again [:(], and with 700 meters to go, I decided to leave the track and battle with the parrot bush. I eventually fell out on the track I needed to be on, where I slowly made my way down towards GZ following wheel tracks that I thought was probably the CO's [?]
As I approached, the arrow indicated that I need to once again leave the track .. where I carefully made my way up the hill. It wasn't wet today, but I could clearly see where someone had slipped down a steep muddy section near the track [:O]. Once at GZ, the cache was quickly found along with a perfectly blank log book [^]
Geez, you don't have the pleasure of finding these beauties in the wild much any more these days .. seems some dodgy folk would rather take them for their own personal use [V]

TFTC and the adventure today parkacruz. I almost forgot how nice it is to wander through this awesome NP [^].  A FP for sure!</groundspeak:text>

   <groundspeak:long_description html="False">--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
James Drummond was born in Inverarity Scotland in Late 1786. Drummond was a Apprentice gardener at Fotheringham Estate before being appointed the curator of the Botanic Garden in Cork Ireland age 21.This was a government funded garden one purpose was the propagation and testing of plants. Drummond discovered several species of plant not known to grow on Ireland at the time. In 1928 The government withdrew funding during the recession and he found himself unemployed with six children to feed.
Shortly afterwards he travelled to Australia on the Parmellia after being appointed the position of  Government Naturalist to the soon to be established Swan River Colony. There was a tempory settlement established on Garden Island where Drummond started his first Garden. His first grant of land was at Guildford. He took possession of the land in 1829 and set about establishing a public nursery. Drummond sought permission of the Governor, Captain James Stirling, to transfer some plants from Garden Island , but was refused permission.
Drummond abandoned the Guildford site after being given 1000 acres of land, now known as the suburb of Ascot. Later he claimed a grant in Helena Valley near the present site Mundaring Weir. 
In 1831 Stirling decided to establish a Government Garden and Nursery adjacent to the Government House. Drummond was appointed the Superintendent and allowed to live in a small house next to the site, he later took over the Gardens 1834 for his own profit, as the caretaker. He was later told to vacate his house as Stirling had decided to build a permanent Government House on the site. He retired his position and returned to Helena Valley and started up a Nursery and Vineyard
In July 1835, James Mangles asked to obtain seeds and plants of Western Australian flora and Drummond was recommended as a botanist and collector.
In 1836, Drummond exchanged his grant on the Helena Valley for land in the Avon Valley. Settling at Toodyay, the Drummonds established a homestead which they named Hawthornden
Drummond continued to collect botanical specimens. In 1839 he received a letter from Sir William Jackson Hooker, who requested seeds and plants and he also invited Drummond to submit written accounts of the botany of the Swan River Colony. Over the next fourteen years, Drummond made numerous collecting expeditions to places like, Vasse district, Morra, Wongan Hills, North and South of Bolgart, King Geoge Sound as far as Cape Riche, Porongurup and Stirling Ranges. In 1850, Drummond joined a surveying expedition that sought to establish a route for overlanding stock to Champion Bay. He spent 1851 in Champion Bay with his son John. He returned to Toodyay in December, and over the next few months he wrote a series of articles on the "Botany of the Northwestern District of Western Australia".
Drummond retired to Hawthornden, where he tended his grape vines and garden. He kept in contact with other botanists. He remained in quiet retirement for ten years. He died on 26 March 1863 and was buried at Hawthornden beside his son Johnston.</groundspeak:long_description>
